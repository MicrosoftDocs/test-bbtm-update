[Azure Stream Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/stream-analytics/stream-analytics-introduction), the recommended service for stream analytics on Azure, easily integrates with your applications and connected devices and sensors to transform streaming data. The process of consuming data streams, analyzing them, and deriving actionable insights is called stream processing. You can transform streaming data using the SQL-like Stream Analytics Query Language to perform temporal and other aggregations against a data stream to gain insights. Streaming data inputs include Azure Event Hubs and IoT Hub. And static data held in Blob storage can also be processed using Stream Analytics jobs.

In this module, you learned how to process streaming data from Azure Event Hubs with Stream Analytics jobs. You then fed the transformed data stream into Power BI to create near-real-time reports and dashboards.

## Learning objectives

In this module, you have:

- Understood stream processing
- Processed streaming data with Azure Stream Analytics
- Created streaming data input from Event Hubs
- Defined Stream Analytics outputs for Power BI and Azure Synapse Analytics
- Described windowing functions
- Written a query using tumbling windows
- Visualized aggregated data using Power BI
