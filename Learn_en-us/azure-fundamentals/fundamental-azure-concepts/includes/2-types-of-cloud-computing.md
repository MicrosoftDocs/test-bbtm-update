## What are public, private, and hybrid clouds?

There are three deployment models for cloud computing: *public cloud*, *private cloud*, and *hybrid cloud*. Each deployment model has different aspects that you should consider as you migrate to the cloud.

    **Public cloud**
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    Services are offered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them. Cloud resources, such as servers and storage, are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider, and delivered over the internet.

    **Private cloud**
  :::column-end:::
  :::column:::
    A private cloud consists of computing resources used exclusively by users from one business or organization. A private cloud can be physically located at your organization's on-site (on-premises) datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider.

  :::column:::
    A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that combines a public cloud and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

## Cloud model comparison

### Public cloud

 -  No capital expenditures to scale up.
 -  Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned.
 -  Organizations pay only for what they use.

### Private cloud

 -  Hardware must be purchased for start-up and maintenance.
 -  Organizations have complete control over resources and security.
 -  Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates.

### Hybrid cloud

 -  Provides the most flexibility.
 -  Organizations determine where to run their applications.
 -  Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements.
