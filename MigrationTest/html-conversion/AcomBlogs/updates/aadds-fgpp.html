<p id="Title">Fine-grained password policy support in Azure AD DS</p>
<p id="Summary">Azure Active Directory Domain Services now supports custom fine-grained password lifetime policies.</p>
<p id="Content"><p style="margin: 0px;">The default password lifetime in Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) is 90 days. Many customers who have longer password lifetimes configured in Azure AD found their users&rsquo; passwords were expiring sooner in Azure AD DS. Many other customers gave us feedback that they&rsquo;d like to configure custom password lifetime, complexity, and account lockout settings for user accounts in custom OUs within Azure AD DS.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0px;">You can now configure fine-grained password policies in Azure AD DS managed domains. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-domain-services/active-directory-ds-password-policy" target="_blank">documentation</a>.</p>
