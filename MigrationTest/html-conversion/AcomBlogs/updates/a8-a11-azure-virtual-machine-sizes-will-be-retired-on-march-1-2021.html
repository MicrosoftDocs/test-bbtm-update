<p id="Title">A8 – A11 Azure Virtual Machine sizes will be retired on March 1, 2021</p>
<p id="Summary">We recommend moving your high performance computing (HPC) workloads to another HPC Virtual Machine size.</p>
<p id="Content"><p>As we continue to bring more modern and optimized <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-previous-gen">virtual machine instances</a> to Azure, on the latest innovations in datacenter hardware, so to must we thoughtfully plan how we retire aging hardware. With this in mind, we are retiring our <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-previous-gen#older-generations-of-virtual-machine-sizes">A8 &ndash; A11 Azure Virtual Machine sizes</a> on <strong>March 1, 2021. </strong>This is a change from our previous announcement of an October 2020 retirement date.</p>

<p><strong>How does this affect me?</strong></p>

<p>Starting today, customers with existing A8 &ndash; A11 size virtual machines will be able to deploy more of the same size, but new customers will no longer be able to create A8 &ndash; A11 VMs.</p>

<p>After March 1, 2021, any remaining A8 &ndash; A11 size virtual machines remaining in your subscription will be set to a deallocated state. These virtual machines will be stopped and removed from the host. These virtual machines will no longer be billed in the deallocated state.</p>

<p><strong>What actions should I take?</strong></p>

<p>Before March 1, 2021, you will need to resize your A8 &ndash; A11 virtual machines. We recommend moving your high performance computing (HPC) workloads to another HPC Virtual Machine size.</p>
