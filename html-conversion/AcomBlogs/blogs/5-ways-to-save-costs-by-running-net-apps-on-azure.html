<p id="Content"><p>Digital transformation is accelerating at an incredible rate for consumers and employees alike, and the way we live and work has drastically changed. As a result, digital demand is surging, often past the capacity of existing infrastructure due to online demand for goods, services, and information. Businesses are shifting overnight from a physical first approach, to a digital first model putting strain on legacy web apps&mdash;both internal and external.</p>

<p>Leveraging our deep expertise in Windows, Visual Studio, and ASP.NET, we designed App Service and Azure SQL Database as the home in the cloud for .NET applications and the databases that power them. Thus, you can be confident with Azure you are hosting your .NET web apps and data on the most cost-effective cloud.</p>

<p>GigaOm recently conducted an independent analyst study, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/costs-and-benefits-of-net-application-migration-to-the-cloud/" target="_blank">Costs and Benefits of .NET Application Migration to the Cloud</a>, which found that Azure is the most cost effective and performant environment to run ASP.NET web workloads. Azure is up to 54 percent less expensive than on-premises and up to 30 percent less expensive than AWS&sup1;. In addition, Azure is the best destination for your Windows Server, SQL Server, and .NET workloads with unparalleled price-performance across our application and database destinations, both <a href="https://gigaom.com/report/sql-transaction-processing-price-performance-testing-azure-eas-vs-aws-r5a/" target="_blank">IaaS</a> and PaaS&sup2;. While there are many ways to save on costs when you choose Azure, here are five ways that can help when migrating your web applications to the cloud.</p>

<p>&sup1;Price-performance claims based on data from a study commissioned by Microsoft and conducted by GigaOm in October 2020. The study compared the price performance of the following environments: On-premises web servers running Windows Server 2016 with a database running Windows Server 2016 and SQL Server 2017; App Service running the PremiumV3 SKU, at the P1 size, with four instances and Azure SQL Database running the Gen5 server type with 4 vCPUs; and an AWS environment on m5d.large EC2 instances provisioned by Elastic Beanstalk with an Amazon RDS db.m5.xlarge database running Microsoft SQL Server 2017. The test application deployed was a Parts Unlimited web store, an ASP.NET application using IIS for a web server and Microsoft SQL Server for the backend. Performance was assessed by running home page load, item search, and item purchase tests, which ran for 60 minutes each. The cost of each environment was calculated using the AWS TCO calculator, AWS Pricing Calculator, and Azure Pricing Calculator. The pricing calculation for Azure used reserved capacity pricing for App Service and Azure SQL Database and the US East region for hosting, while the pricing calculation for AWS used reserved instance pricing and the us-east-1 region for hosting. Pricing includes Azure Hybrid Benefit, which allows existing Windows Server and SQL Server licenses to be applied to Azure virtual machines and Azure SQL Database instances. The total cost is an estimate of running the application for three years. Actual results and prices may vary based on configuration and region.</p>

<p>&sup2;Price-performance claims based on data from a study commissioned by Microsoft and conducted by GigaOm in February 2020. The study compared price performance between SQL Server 2019 Enterprise Edition on Windows Server 2019 Datacenter edition in Azure E32as_v4 instance type with P30 Premium SSD Disks and the SQL Server 2019 Enterprise Edition on Windows Server 2019 Datacenter edition in AWS EC2 r5a.8xlarge instance type with General Purpose (gp2) volumes. Benchmark data is taken from a GigaOm Analytic Field Test derived from a recognized industry standard, TPC Benchmark&trade; E (TPC-E). The Field Test does not implement the full TPC-E benchmark and as such is not comparable to any published TPC-E benchmarks. Prices are based on publicly available US pricing in West US for SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines and Northern California for AWS EC2 as of January 2020. The pricing incorporates three-year reservations for Azure and AWS compute pricing, and Azure Hybrid Benefit for SQL Server and Azure Hybrid Benefit for Windows Server and License Mobility for SQL Server in AWS, excluding Software Assurance costs. Actual results and prices may vary based on configuration and region.</p>

<p>&sup3;Savings reflect reservation prices for US East. Premium v3 not available in all regions, check the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator" target="_blank">Azure Pricing Calculator</a> for regional availability and exact pricing.</p>
