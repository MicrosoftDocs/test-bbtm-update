<p id="Title">Azure Active Directory support for Azure Relay now in public preview</p>
<p id="Summary">Azure Relay now supports authentication and authorization via Azure AD as a public preview offering. With Azure AD, you don't need to store tokens in your code.</p>
<p id="Content"><p>We are&nbsp;announcing the public preview for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)&nbsp;support for Azure Relay. With this, Azure Relay is supporting another way of authentication and authorization via Azure AD in addition to Shared Access Signatures (SAS).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Azure AD&nbsp;integration for Azure Relay resources provides Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) for fine-grained control over a client&rsquo;s access to resources</p>

<p>Authorizing users or applications using OAuth 2.0 token returned by Azure AD provides superior security and ease of use over shared access signatures (SAS). With Azure AD, there is no need to store tokens in your code and risk potential security vulnerabilities. We recommend that you use Azure AD with your Azure Relay applications when possible.</p>
