    "Content": "<p>Today, we&rsquo;re excited to announce the general availability of the <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/app-service/\" target=\"_blank\">new Premium plan</a> from Azure App Service that runs on <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-general#dv2-series\" target=\"_blank\">Dv2-series VMs</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Azure App Service allows you to quickly build, deploy, and scale enterprise-grade web, mobile, and API apps running on any platform. Applications and services running on App Service can meet rigorous performance, scalability, security, and compliance requirements while leveraging a fully-managed platform to take care of infrastructure maintenance. This update brings additional horsepower to your applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Two months ago, we <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-app-service-premium-v2-in-public-preview/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the preview of the new Premium tier for Azure App Service featuring <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-general#dv2-series\" target=\"_blank\">Dv2-series VMs</a> with faster processors, SSD storage, and doubled memory-to-core ratio when compared to the previous instances. Today, the new Premium plan is generally available.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It puts more application performance at your disposal. You can use it to build mission-critical applications faster, taking advantage of App Service&rsquo;s enterprise grade capabilities including high availability with geo-distributed deployments, securing apps with Azure Active Directory (AAD) integration, and built-in SSL support. It runs on a cloud platform that complies with ISO information security standards, SOC2 accounting standards, and PCI security standards, just to name a few.</p>\n\n<p>Getting started with the new Premium tier is easy. You can leverage Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, Azure Command Line Interface (CLI) scripts, or the Azure Portal user interface to configure a performant, scalable, and reliable environment in seconds.</p>\n\n<p>We are excited about the addition of the newer, faster hardware underpinning the new Premium tier.
