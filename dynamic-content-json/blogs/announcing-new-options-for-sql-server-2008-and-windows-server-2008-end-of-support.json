    "Content": "<p>It&rsquo;s incredible how much and how rapidly technology evolves. Microsoft&rsquo;s server technology is no exception. We entered the 2008 release cycle with a shift from 32-bit to 64-bit computing, the early days of server virtualization and advanced analytics. Fast forward a decade, and we find ourselves in a full-blown era of hybrid cloud computing with exciting innovation in data, artificial intelligence, and more.</p>\n\n<p>I want to thank our customers for choosing SQL Server and Windows Server to run their business and trusting Microsoft to be their technology partner. I would also like to make sure we support our customers in getting ready for the future and taking maximum advantage of today&rsquo;s technologies. End of support is quickly approaching for these popular 2008 releases:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Extended Support for SQL Server 2008 and 2008 R2 will end on July 9, 2019.</li>\n\t<li>Extended Support for Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2 will end on January 14, 2020.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>End of support means the end of regular security updates. With cyberattacks becoming more sophisticated and frequent, running apps and data on unsupported versions can create significant security and compliance risks. The 2008 family of products was great for its time, but we highly recommend upgrading to the most current versions for better performance, efficiency, and regular security updates.</p>\n\n<p>The upcoming end of support milestone is a great opportunity to transform your applications and infrastructure to take advantage of cloud computing and the latest versions of SQL Server and Windows Server. Customers like <a href=\"https://customers.microsoft.com/en-US/story/allscripts-partner-professional-services-azure\" target=\"_blank\">Allscripts</a> rehosted dozens of applications running on thousands of virtual machines to Azure, where they can transform and develop new applications using more advanced Azure services.</p>\n\n<p>We are pleased to share new options and tools to help you manage this transition to carry your organization through the next decade.</p>\n\n<h2>Migrate to Azure, get free Extended Security Updates</h2>\n\n<p>End of support is an ideal time to transform your IT estate with the cloud. But we know that it can be hard to upgrade everything before the end of support timeline. To address this need, we are pleased to announce that Extended Security Updates will be available for free in Azure for 2008 and 2008 R2 versions of SQL Server and Windows Server to help secure your workloads for three more years after the end of support deadline. You can rehost these workloads to Azure with no application code change. This gives you more time to plan your future path, including upgrading to newer versions such as SQL Server 2017 or Windows Server 2016 and utilizing the rich set of platform and data services available in Azure.</p>\n\n<p>You can also move your SQL Server 2008 and 2008 R2 deployments with no application code change and near zero downtime to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance. It is a fully-managed database-as-a-service solution with industry leading SLAs and does not require future upgrades. Azure SQL Database Managed Instance will be generally available in early Q4 of this calendar year.</p>\n\n<p>You can use existing licenses and the <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/hybrid-benefit/\">Azure Hybrid Benefit</a> to save when you migrate SQL Server and Windows Server environments to Azure Virtual Machines or to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance. With this benefit, customers with Software Assurance save up to 55 percent on the cost of running SQL Server and Windows Server in Azure.</p>\n\n<h2>Upgrade on-premises environments and stay protected</h2>\n\n<p>For apps and data that you want to keep running on-premises, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest version of SQL Server and Windows Server to get the strongest security and latest innovation. SQL Server 2017 and Windows Server 2016 are the new standard for performance and efficiency, and both include built-in security features to help you harden your platform. Now is also the time to consider refreshing your server infrastructure. Today&rsquo;s servers and hyperconverged solutions can deliver important security features, as well as dramatic increases in performance and cost efficiency. Microsoft partners offer a variety of <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/wssd\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Server Software Defined</a> solutions to meet your needs in the datacenter. Or consider <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/azure-stack/\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Stack</a> for a consistent hybrid cloud solution.</p>\n\n<p>For on-premises servers that need more time to upgrade, you will be able to purchase Extended Security Updates for three more years. This option is available to customers with Software Assurance or Subscription licenses under an Enterprise Agreement enrollment and can be purchased annually to cover only the servers that require the updates. It&rsquo;s a great option to continue getting security updates while you upgrade or migrate to Azure.</p>\n\n<h2>Get started with a visit to our End of Support Resource Center</h2>\n\n<p>Now that you know your options, it&rsquo;s time to get started.
