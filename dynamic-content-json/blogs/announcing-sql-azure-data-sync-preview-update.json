    "Content": "<p>Today we are pleased to announce that the SQL Azure Data Sync preview release has been upgraded to Service Update 4 (SU4) within the <a href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/?WT_id=cmp_pst001_blg_post0085\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Azure</a> data centers.&nbsp; SU4 is now running live. This update adds the most -requested feature: <b>users can edit an existing Sync Group to accommodate changes they have made to their database schemas,</b><b> without having to re-create the Sync Group</b>. &nbsp;In order to use the new Edit Sync Group feature, you must install the latest release of the local agent software, available <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=27693\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Existing Sync Groups do not need to be re-created, they will work with the new features automatically.</p>  <p>The complete list of changes are listed below:</p>  <ul>  <li>Users &nbsp;can now modify a sync group without having to recreate it. See the MSDN topic <b>Edit a Sync Group </b>for details.  <ul>  <li>New information in the portal helps customers more easily manage sync groups:  <ul>  <li>The portal displays the upgrade and support status of the user&rsquo;s local agent software:&nbsp; the local &nbsp;agent version is shown with a recommendation to upgrade if your client agent is not the latest, a warning if support for your agent version expires soon and an error if your agent is no longer supported.</li>  <li>The portal displays a warning for sync groups that may become out-of-date if changes fail to apply for 60 or more days.</li>  </ul>  </li>  </ul>  </li>  <li>The update fixes issues that affected ORM (Object Relational Model) frameworks such as Entity Framework and NHibernate working with Data Sync.</li>  <li>The service provides better error and status messages.</li>  </ul>  <p>If you are using SQL Azure and are not familiar with SQL Azure Data Sync, you can watch this online video demonstration.</p>  <p>The ability to edit an existing Sync Group enables some common customer scenarios, and we have listed some of these below as examples.</p>  <h3>Scenario 1: User adds a table and a&nbsp;column to a sync group</h3>  <ul>  <li>William uses Data Sync to keep the products databases in his branch offices up to date.</li>  <li>He decides to add a new Material attribute to his products to indicate whether the product is made from Animal, Vegetable or Mineral.</li>  <li>He adds a Material column to his Products table and a Material table to contain the range of material values.</li>  <li>He modifies his sync group to include the new Material table and the new Material column in the Product table.</li>  <li>The Data Sync service adjusts the sync configuration in William&rsquo;s databases and begins synchronizing the new data.</li>  <li>William categorizes his products using a Category ID in his Products table, which references records in a Category table in his database.</li>  <li>He decides to discontinue the use of the Category attribute in favor of a set of descriptive tags which apply to each product.</li>  <li>He modifies his application to use the descriptive tags in place of the Category attribute.</li>  <li>William modifies the Sync Group to exclude the Category attribute for his Products table.</li>  <li>He modifies the Sync Group to exclude the Category table.</li>  <li>The Data Sync service adjusts the sync configuration in William&rsquo;s databases and no longer synchronizes the Category data.</li>  <li>William maintains a set of attributes for his products that include Notes and Thumbnail images.</li>  <li>William decides to increase the length of the columns he uses to store these attributes:</li>  <li>He changes the Notes column from CHAR(32) to CHAR(128) to accommodate more verbose notes.</li>  <li>He changes the Thumbnail column from BINARY(1000) to BINARY(MAX) to hold higher resolution thumbnail images.</li>  <li>William modifies his application to use the expanded attributes.</li>  <li>William modifies his database by altering the Notes and Thumbnail columns to the larger sizes.</li>  <li>He updates his Sync Group with the new column lengths for the Notes and Thumbnail columns.</li>  <li>The Data Sync service adjusts the sync configuration in William&rsquo;s databases and synchronizes the expanded columns.</li>  </ul>  <h3>Scenario 2: User removes a table and a column from a sync group</h3>  <ul>  <li>William categorizes his products using a Category ID in his Products table, which references records in a Category table in his database.</li>  <li>He decides to discontinue the use of the Category attribute in favor of a set of descriptive tags which apply to each product.</li>  <li>He modifies his application to use the descriptive tags in place of the Category attribute.</li>  <li>William modifies the Sync Group to exclude the Category attribute for his Products table.</li>  <li>He modifies the Sync Group to exclude the Category table.</li>  <li>The Data Sync service adjusts the sync configuration in William&rsquo;s databases and no longer synchronizes the Category data.&nbsp;</li>  </ul>  <h3>Scenario 3: User changes the length of a column in a sync group</h3>  <ul>  <li>William maintains a set of attributes for his products that include Notes and Thumbnail images.</li>  <li>William decides to increase the length of the columns he uses to store these attributes:</li>  <li>He changes the Notes column from CHAR(32) to CHAR(128) to accommodate more verbose notes.</li>  <li>He changes the Thumbnail column from BINARY(1000) to BINARY(MAX) to hold higher resolution thumbnail images.</li>  <li>William modifies his application to use the expanded attributes.</li>  <li>William modifies his database by altering the Notes and Thumbnail columns to the larger sizes.</li>  <li>He updates his Sync Group with the new column lengths for the Notes and Thumbnail columns.</li>  <li>The Data Sync service adjusts the sync configuration in William&rsquo;s databases and synchronizes the expanded columns.</li>  </ul>  <h3>Sharing Your Feedback</h3>  <p>For community-based support, post a question to the SQL Azure MSDN forums.
