    "Content": "<p>Genomics is foundational to the development of targeted therapeutics and precision medicine. Advances in DNA sequencing technologies has driven a revolution in genomics-based research and is helping facilitate better understanding of human biology and disease conditions. This expanded knowledge is leading to the proliferation of personalized medicine strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases. The trend will continue to accelerate in the coming decade as use of genomics information becomes central to clinical decision support and healthcare delivery.</p>\n\n<p>Sequencing genomes at the population level will be required to decipher the genomic fingerprint of a disease, predict interpersonal variability in progression and treatment response, and develop models for clinical decision support. The resulting explosion in genomics data and the computational power required for analysis (tens of exabytes and trillions of core hours in the next five years<sup>1</sup>) will require agility, easier management, data security, and access to scalable storage and compute capacity.</p>\n\n<p>The demand for cloud-based solutions is evident. It is increasingly being recognized that community driven standards and open-source tools will be necessary in enabling data accessibility, tool interoperability, and reliability of results and models. Microsoft not only supports open-standards and open-source projects but has been actively contributing to these community driven efforts by making it easier to use these tools and software on Azure.</p>\n\n<p>To that end, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/genomics/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Genomics</a> has released several open source projects on GitHub, including Cromwell on Azure, Genomics Notebooks and Bioconductor support for Azure. We have also made available a growing list of genomics public datasets on the Azure Open Dataset platform.</p>\n\n<h2>Scale and automate genomic workflows on Azure with Cromwell</h2>\n\n<p>Cromwell is an open-source workflow management system geared toward scientific workflows, originally developed by the Broad Institute. With <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure\" target=\"_blank\">Cromwell on Azure</a>, users can accelerate their genomic research with the hyperscale compute capabilities of Azure. Cromwell orchestrates the dynamic provisioning of computing resources via Azure Batch and integrates with customers&rsquo; Azure Blob storage account for easy data access.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/6fc5e4ed-90e8-4068-8c1e-6d8a2e882d22.png\"><img alt=\"Example architecture for genomics workflows using Cromwell on Azure.\" border=\"0\" height=\"341\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/8a15fc13-c377-4c8c-8ac1-df31e5c8296c.png\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"Example architecture for genomics workflows using Cromwell on Azure.\" width=\"1024\"></a></p>\n\n<h3>Propelling novel next generation sequencing (NGS) based detection and characterization assay for COVID-19 with Biotia</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.biotia.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Biotia</a> is an emerging startup focused on building a platform leveraging next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) and artificial intelligence (AI) for precision disease detection and diagnosis. They were looking for a cloud-based workflow solution to manage their NGS pipelines and Cromwell on Azure was able to meet their key requirements.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>&quot;At Biotia, we have achieved substantial parallelization, thorough version control, and novel COVID-19 detection results by using Cromwell on Azure to back our compute-intensive genomics workflows. We are pleased to include Cromwell on Azure in our bioinformatics software stack.&quot;</em> &mdash;Joe Barrows, Director of Software Engineering at Biotia</p>\n\n<h2>Enable collaborative and repeatable data analysis using Genomics Notebooks powered by Jupyter Notebooks on Azure</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://jupyter.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Jupyter Notebooks</a> provides users an environment for analyzing data using R or Python and enabling reusability of methods and reproducibility of results. Biomedical researchers and data scientists are increasingly using notebooks for their genomics data analysis needs and for building machine learning models based on multi-modal datasets (genomic, phenotypic, clinical, EMR, demographic, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/genomicsnotebook\" target=\"_blank\">Genomics Notebooks</a> open-source project provides a growing collection of pre-configured notebooks that users can easily launch and use in their Azure workspace. These pre-configured notebooks cover scenarios from genomics variant detection, filtration, annotation, to transformation of the genomic, phenotypic and clinical data into multi-modal data frames needed for data querying and building machine learning models.</p>\n\n<h2>Leveraging genomic data to assess the impact of environmental change with the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans</h2>\n\n<p>The Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) is responsible for preserving Canada&rsquo;s aquatic natural resources. DFO researchers at the <u><a href=\"https://www.bio.gc.ca/index-en.php\" target=\"_blank\">Bedford Institute of Oceanography</a></u> in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia have been using genomics to understand the impact of climate change and human activity on the migration patterns, genetic diversity and population demography of fish such as Atlantic Salmon and Atlantic Cod, which can have major socio-economic implications for the communities that rely on these resources.</p>\n\n<p>The research teams are starting to sequence fish genomes in the hundreds and were looking for Azure based solutions for scaling and streamlining their growing genomics and data analysis needs. The team successfully deployed, and scale tested Cromwell on Azure and is now looking to adopt it as a common genomics workflow platform across their various institutions.</p>\n\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><i>&ldquo;Leveraging Cromwell on Azure for running our genomics pipelines give us the ability to scale our analysis to thousands of genomes for any species of fish with automation. We can essentially eliminate three months&rsquo; time of manual work to generate all the variant calls we need and move directly into connecting that data with other data sources we have. The data science tools will help us easily build and train complex multi-modal data models to gain deeper insights into the impact resulting from interactions between genetic factors, climate information, and human impacts on these species, and predict how they might respond to environmental challenges in the future.&rdquo;</i> &mdash;Dr. Tony Kess, Researcher at the Bradbury Population Genomics Lab, a part of the Bedford Institute of Oceanography in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia</p>\n\n<h2>Easily access the vast collection of community-built bioinformatics tools with Bioconductor on Azure</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bioconductor.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Bioconductor</a> is an open source, open development project that focuses on providing a repository of extensible statistical and graphical software packages, developed in R, for the analysis of high-throughput genomic and biomedical data.
