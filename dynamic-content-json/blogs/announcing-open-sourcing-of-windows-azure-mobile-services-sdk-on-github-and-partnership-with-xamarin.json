    "Content": "<p>A little over three weeks ago, we debuted Windows Azure Mobile Services&mdash;a turnkey backend solution for your Windows Store app.&nbsp; As part of our continuing commitment to open source, we are happy to announce today that the Mobile Services SDK will be available on GitHub, and as always we are welcoming community contributions.&nbsp; We are also proud to announce that we are partnering with <a href=\"https://xamarin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Xamarin</a> to deliver the ability to write iOS and Android apps in C# and then tie them to a scalable and secure Mobile Services backend.</p>  <p>Subsequent Mobile Services preview releases will add full support for native iOS, Android, and Windows Phone apps through the Windows Azure portal.</p>  <p>For more information, please visit the <a href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/mobile/?WT.mc_id=cmp_pst001_blg_post0208mdv\" target=\"_blank\">Mobile Services developer center</a>.</p>  <h4>Mobile Services on GitHub</h4>  <p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-mobile-services\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Azure Mobile Services Repository</a> contains the Mobile Services SDK. We will continue to develop the Mobile Services SDK openly and transparently in this repository. All code in this repository will be fully supported by Microsoft, and community contributions are welcome! You can find Windows Azure SDK contribution guidelines <a href=\"https://windowsazure.github.com/guidelines.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>  <h4>Mobile Services &amp; Xamarin</h4>  <p>Xamarin is partnering with <a href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/features/mobile-services//?WT.mc_id=cmp_pst001_blg_post0208mob\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Azure Mobile Services</a> to expand the Mobile Services SDK to iOS and Android platforms. Xamarin products empower more than 175,000 developers to write native apps for iOS and Android&mdash;all in C#.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Mobile Services and Xamarin share a common goal: freeing developers to focus on what really matters.&nbsp; Mobile Services reduces the friction of configuring a scalable and secure backend and lets mobile app developers focus on delivering a fantastic user experience.&nbsp; Xamarin allows mobile app developers to make the most of C#, and enables mobile developers to support more devices with less code.</p>  <p>&nbsp;For tutorials and more information on how to get started, please visit the Xamarin <a href=\"https://blog.xamarin.com/2012/09/20/xamarin-partners-with-microsoft-to-support-azure-mobile-services-on-android-and-ios/\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.xamarin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">developer center</a>.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Questions?&nbsp; Ask in the <a href=\"https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/azuremobile/threads\" target=\"_blank\">Mobile Services Forum</a>.
