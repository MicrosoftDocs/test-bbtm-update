Finally, we announced new sizes in the Azure Data Box Heavy (1 PB) is in preview and Azure Data Box (100 TB) is now GA. Learn more at the <a href=\"https://azure.com/migration\" target=\"_blank\">Azure migration center</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To help improve your migration experience, we are announcing that if you migrate Windows Server or SQL Server 2008/R2 to Azure, you will get three years of free extended security updates on those systems. This could save you some money when <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-new-offers-and-capabilities-that-make-azure-the-best-place-for-all-your-apps-data-and-infrastructure/\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Server and SQL Server 2008/ R2 end of support</a> (EOS). If you combine the savings from with Azure Hybrid Benefit and Reserved Instances, running these servers on AWS will be 5 times more expensive than on Azure.</p>\n\n<p>As I reflect on these announcements, I am really excited by what you will be able to do and build on Azure this next year!&nbsp; Our goal with Azure is to enable you to do more in your business. To do that, we are building the very best cloud for your needs, offering infrastructure for every workload, hybrid capabilities unlike any other cloud, cost effective features, and built-in security and management.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If you are at Ignite, please do engage with the product experts at the booths or hanging around. We can help you start your first infrastructure migration or work on your last application modernization project. I am looking forward to seeing you all in the cloud, whatever that looks like to you!</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you are reading this, I am really impressed you finished my blog. I did say plethora&hellip;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n\n<p>Corey</p>\n"
