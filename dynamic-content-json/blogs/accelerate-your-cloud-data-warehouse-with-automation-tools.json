Tasks such as continuous integration and continuous delivery require extensive manual coding and doesn't offer the flexibility needed for the rapidly changing business needs. This is where data warehouse automation tools provide value for customers.</p>\n\n<p>Data warehouse automation (DWA) tools are meta-data driven, code generation tools that streamline developing and managing a data warehouse solution. DWA tools provide more than just ETL automation, they automate the complete life cycle of a data warehouse solution, from analysis, design, and implementation to documentation, monitoring and maintenance.</p>\n\n<h2>Benefits of data warehouse automation</h2>\n\n<p>Data warehouse automation (DWA) tools bring the benefits of meta-data driven automation, and code generation to streamline developing and managing a data warehouse solution. DWA tools provide more than just ETL automation, they automate the complete life cycle of a data warehouse solution, from analysis, design, and implementation to documentation, monitoring and maintenance.</p>\n\n<p><b>Acceleration</b>: By automating repeatable, tedious tasks such as source discovery, fact and dimension mapping, dimension type assignment, change-impact analysis and version control, DWA tools accelerate time to market for data warehouse projects.</p>\n\n<p>“<i>WhereScape automates the design, development and operation of agile data warehouse projects by increasing developer productivity by 10x. It leverages the enormous processing power of Azure SQL DW’s MPP architecture together with the ease of use and support that comes with using T-SQL as the processing and query language.</i>”</p>\n\n<p>– Douglas Barrett, Senior Solutions Architect, WhereScape</p>\n\n<p><b>Consistency</b>: By leveraging data warehouse design patterns and platform specific best practices, these tools deliver consistent, high quality code. Automatically-generated documentation improves understanding and helps with troubleshooting.</p>\n\n<p><i>“It’s exciting to see BimlFlex customers benefiting from our Azure SQL DW automation experience. We provide optimal implementations that employ patterns approved by industry experts and Microsoft product teams - and can be selected or changed through simple modifications to our metadata store.”</i></p>\n\n<p>– Scott Currie, CEO, Varigence</p>\n\n<p><b>Simplicity</b>: Graphical user interface (GUI) with point-and-click design capability offered by most DWA tools, simplify the user experience for source exploration, modelling fact and dimension tables, designing ETL pipelines and reporting.</p>\n\n<p><b>Flexibility</b>: By shortening iteration cycles, DWA tools help IT and business teams focus on business requirements and reduce the time-to-insight, increasing the business value of data warehousing.</p>\n\n<p><i>“AnalytiX DS Epicenter’s metadata driven automation platform allows code to be automatically generated to truly accelerate time to value for customers while automatically documenting the data integration processes in Epicenter’s enterprise data mapping platform”</i></p>\n\n<p>– Michael Boggs, CTO and Founder of AnalytiX DS</p>\n\n<h2>SQL DW and data warehouse automation partners</h2>\n\n<p>The following data warehouse automation partners have certified their tools with SQL DW:</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://bigenius.info/\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"240\" height=\"120\" title=\"biGENiUS_Logo_500x500px_ohne_R (002)\" style=\"border-image: none; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;\" alt=\"biGENiUS_Logo_500x500px_ohne_R (002)\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/5ff3d0a4-5932-4edc-8f67-4064e18c9a6b.jpg\" border=\"0\"></a><a href=\"https://www.wherescape.com/partners/microsoft/\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"240\" height=\"43\" title=\"Print\" style=\"border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" alt=\"Print\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/e8a4a04f-c2d6-4778-9009-aba535c040ae.png\" border=\"0\"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.analyticscreator.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"240\" height=\"30\" title=\"image\" style=\"border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/5f1cdd9f-baf4-4563-a0cf-e077b09fb697.png\" border=\"0\"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.analyticscreator.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><a href=\"https://varigence.com/BimlFlex\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"240\" height=\"80\" title=\"image\" style=\"border-image: none; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/8a15933b-80d8-42df-9e33-7118e324a82b.png\" border=\"0\"></a></a></a></p>\n\n<p>“<i>We help data driven companies be more successful with their data management.
