    "Content": "<p>Data is central to digital transformation. We have seen many customers moving their data workloads to Azure which benefits from the inherent performance and agility of cloud. Enterprises are moving on-premises workloads to public cloud at an increasing rate. Results from the 2016 Harvey Nash/KPMG CIO Survey indicate that cloud adoption is now mainstream and accelerating as enterprises shift data-intensive operations to the cloud. Specifically, Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) adoption is predicted to be the fastest-growing sector of cloud platforms according to KPMG, growing from 32 percent in 2017 to 56 percent adoption in 2020.</p>\n\n<p>Cloud data warehouse is one of the fastest growing segments. <a href=\"https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/cloudosdigital/Lists/BlogForm/Attachments/1458/azure.com/sqldw\" target=\"_blank\">Azure SQL Data Warehouse</a> (SQL DW) allows customers to unleash the elasticity and economics of cloud while maintain a fast, flexible and secure warehouse for all their data.<br>\nMicrosoft has partnered with Informatica, the leader in Enterprise Cloud Data Management, to help you modernize your data architecture with intelligent data management.
