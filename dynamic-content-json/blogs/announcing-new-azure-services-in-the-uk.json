    "Content": "<p>We&rsquo;re pleased to announce the following services which are now available in the UK!</p>\n\n<p><strong>HDInsight </strong>&ndash;&nbsp; HDInsight is a 100% compatible Hadoop service that allows you to easily provision and manage Hadoop clusters for big data processing in Azure.</p>\n\n<p>HDInsight is the only fully-managed cloud Hadoop offering that provides optimized open source analytic clusters for Spark, Hive, MapReduce, HBase, Storm, Kafka, and R Server backed by a 99.9% SLA.&nbsp; Each of these big data technologies and ISV applications are easily deployable as managed clusters with enterprise-level security and monitoring.&nbsp; Learn more about <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/hdinsight/\">HDInsight</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Azure Import/Export service <strong>now</strong> also available in UK is the perfect companion service to use with HDInsight &ndash; the combination allows you to easily ingest, process and optionally export a limitless amount of data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Azure Import/Export</strong> -&nbsp;&nbsp; Import/Export Service is now live in UK South! The Azure Import/Export Service enables you to move large amounts of on-premises data into and out of your Azure Storage accounts. It does this by enabling you to securely ship hard disk drives directly to our Azure data centers. Once we receive the drives we&rsquo;ll automatically transfer the data to or from your Azure Storage account.&nbsp; This enables you to import or export massive amounts of data more quickly and cost effectively (and not be constrained by available network bandwidth).</p>\n\n<p>Customers can now use Azure Import/Export Service to copy data to and from Azure Storage by shipping hard disk drives to Azure UK South data center.</p>\n\n<p>For more information about creating import/export jobs see, <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-import-export-service/\">Use the Microsoft Azure Import/Export Service to transfer data to Blob Storage</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Azure Container Registry</strong> -&nbsp; Azure Container Registry is a private registry for hosting container images. Using the Azure Container Registry, customers can store Docker-formatted images for all types of container deployments. Azure Container Registry integrates well with orchestrators hosted in Azure Container Service, including Docker Swarm, DC/OS and Kubernetes. Users can benefit from using familiar tooling capable of working with the open source Docker Registry v2.</p>\n\n<p>Customers can now create one or more container registries in their Azure subscription. Each registry is backed by a standard Azure storage account in the same location. Take advantage of local, network-close storage of your container images by creating a registry in the same Azure location as your deployments. Learn more about <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-intro\">Azure Container Registry</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We are excited about these additions, and invite customers using the UK Azure region to try them today!</p>\n"
