    "Content": "<p><a href=\"https://ww2.frost.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Frost and Sullivan</a> has estimated the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Market for Healthcare IT in 2018 for hospitals at $574 million USD and expects it to grow at a CAGR of 65 percent to $4.3 billion USD in 2022! Similar explosive growth is predicted across other segments of healthcare. Machine Learning (ML) is a type of AI that has already seen successful application in healthcare, particularly rapid growth, and shows major untapped potential to further help improve healthcare going forward. Key use cases range from resource and asset optimization to readmission prevention, chatbots, anti-fraud, behavioral analytics, medical risk analytics, claims analytics, cybersecurity, and many more. Business values driving healthcare organizations to deploy AI solutions across these use cases span cost reduction, improving patient outcomes, and improving the engagement and experiences of patients and healthcare professionals. Major opportunities for startups range from creating AI products and solutions for specific use cases and healthcare needs to services for education, customizing AI solutions, integrating them with existing enterprise systems and data stores, managing and operating solutions, and so forth.

The major way to run lean is by avoiding capital expense of data center equipment, and expensive IT and cyber security staff (Azure has numerous built-in security measures &mdash; see <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/security/azure-security?WT.mc_id=aihealthcare-blueprint-dahouldi\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Security</a>). Microsoft Azure enables you to acquire just the right amount of data center capability you require and address it as an operating expense, rather than a capital expense. You can also focus your limited resources on creating your AI solution versus building, securing, and managing low-level data center infrastructure. Microsoft Azure enables you to start free, and supports a wide range of open source technologies including a wide variety of tools such as Node.js to multiple operating systems from <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/create-upload-ubuntu?WT.mc_id=aihealthcare-blueprint-dahouldi\" target=\"_blank\">Ubuntu</a>, to <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/debian-create-upload-vhd?WT.mc_id=aihealthcare-blueprint-dahouldi\" target=\"_blank\">Debian</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/suse-create-upload-vhd?WT.mc_id=aihealthcare-blueprint-dahouldi\" target=\"_blank\">SUSE</a>, and more.</p>\n\n<h2>Start quickly</h2>\n\n<p>With any compelling idea, there is a finite window of opportunity, and time is of the essence for any startup, especially those in AI where innovation is moving at a brisk and accelerating pace. With Microsoft Azure you can deploy web apps and Virtual Machines (VMs) in seconds. Furthermore, rather than start your cloud at zero with a blank slate, you can bootstrap your solution in Microsoft Azure with blueprints that include example code, test data, automated deployment, documentation, and security and compliance support. This approach gets you a working reference solution in your Microsoft Azure cloud, and 50-90 percent towards your end solution. From that beginning, you can get started on your pilot as soon as possible and rapidly close the gap to your end solution.
