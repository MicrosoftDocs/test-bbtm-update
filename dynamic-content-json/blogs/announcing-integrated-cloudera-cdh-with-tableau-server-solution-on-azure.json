    "Content": "<p style=\"background: white; margin: 12px 0px; line-height: normal;\">Developers and IT-Pros usually start their Cloud journey by installing software on virtual machines.&nbsp; While this makes it easy to create running Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), it requires additional work to load data and develop a coherent business solution.&nbsp; Today we&rsquo;re excited to announce a quick and easy way for the moderately technical user to get started with a pre-bundled visual analytics &amp; big data solution running on Microsoft Azure: <a href=\"https://partnerquickstarts.azurewebsites.net/#/quickstart/cloudera-tableau\">The Tableau/Cloudera Quickstart</a>, built by Slalom.</p>\n\n<p style=\"background: white; margin: 12px 0px; line-height: normal;\">We are also inviting everyone to join us on <b>May 24, 2017,</b> for a Webinar and demonstration of this solution delivered by Slalom and Microsoft. RSVP here - <a href=\"https://azuretraining.spektrasystems.com/#/event?ef3bc57d-0133-4b9e-8905-51d7f65420f2\">Webinar: Multi-Server Cloudera deployment on Azure</a>.</p>\n\n<p style=\"background: white; margin: 12px 0px; line-height: normal;\">To process and rationalize the large amounts of data produced in today&rsquo;s modern businesses, users need flexible, sophisticated visualization tools combined with Internet-scale data processing clusters.&nbsp; As you may already know, Tableau&rsquo;s Server is acclaimed for self-service data visualization and collaboration, whereas Cloudera&rsquo;s Enterprise Data Hub (CDH) framework provides robust data management and processing. Numerous customers are deploying these solutions every day on Azure, and both solutions can be found in the <a href=\"https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us\"><u>Azure Marketplace</u></a>.</p>\n\n<p style=\"background: white; margin: 12px 0px; line-height: normal;\">As a way for our customers to quickly experience the power of Azure and the strengths of our market-leading partners Tableau and Cloudera, Microsoft teamed up with <a href=\"https://www.slalom.com/\">Slalom</a> to develop a sample, integrated business solution.&nbsp; Whether you deploy for trial purposes, for a proof of concept, or a production environment, you can get started with this solution with very little configuration and setup effort. &nbsp;Simply follow the <a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/blob/master/cloudera-tableau/Cloudera%20%2B%20Tableau%20Quickstart%20Deployment%20and%20Usage%20Guide.pdf\">Quickstart Cloudera + Tableau Deployment Guide</a>, and you will end up with a pre-configured, Azure-optimized cluster of VM&rsquo;s running Cloudera CDH that is pre-loaded with data. This cluster will also contain a Tableau server VM that is pre-configured with a Tableau retail dashboard that allows you to work with and analyze the Cloudera CDH data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style=\"background: white; margin: 12px 0px; line-height: normal;\">The solution is designed to configure all the necessary components and the network topology, so you can focus on your data ingestion, management, analytics, and insights. If you have specific environment requirements or you prefer to customize the setup, you also have the flexibility to fork the repository, update the ARM Template and deploy the <a href=\"https://partnerquickstarts.azurewebsites.net/#/quickstart/cloudera-tableau\"><u>Cloudera with Tableau solution</u></a> to fit your needs.</p>\n\n<p style=\"background: white; margin: 12px 0px; line-height: normal;\">We hope this helps with your Azure journey with Cloudera and Tableau &ndash; and we are looking forward to your comments.
