The ecosystem of productivity applications in Big data has grown with the goal of making it easier for customers to solve their big data and analytical problems faster. Today, customers often find it challenging to discover these productivity applications and then in turn struggle to install and configure these apps.</p>\n\n<p>To address this gap, the <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-hdinsight-application-platform-install-solutions-built-for-the-apache-hadoop-ecosystem/\" target=\"_blank\">HDInsight Application Platform</a> provides a unique experience to HDInsight where Independent Software Vendors (ISV&rsquo;s) can directly offer their applications to customers - and customers can easily discover, install and use these applications built for the Big data ecosystem by a single click.</p>\n\n<p>The largest and most time-consuming challenge for analytics is simply getting the data ready.
