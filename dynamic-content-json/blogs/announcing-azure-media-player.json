    "Content": "<h2>Reach the most popular devices with a single development experience</h2>\n\n<p>Azure Media Player is a free player solution built to playback media content from Microsoft Azure Media Services. Azure Media Player has the ability to reach a wide variety of browsers and devices with a simple HTML and JavaScript code. Azure Media Player is easy to set up and use. It only takes a few minutes to get playback of media content working from your Azure Media Services account.</p>\n\n<h2>What is Azure Media Player?</h2>\n\n<p>Azure Media Player utilizes industry standards, such as HTML5 (MSE/EME) to provide an enriched adaptive streaming experience. When these standards are not available on a device or in a browser, Azure Media Player automatically uses Flash and Silverlight as fallback technology. Regardless of the playback technology used, developers will have a unified JavaScript interface to access APIs. This allows for content served by Azure Media Services to be played across a wide-range of devices and browsers without any extra effort. Microsoft Azure Media Services allows for content to be streamed using DASH, Smooth Streaming and HLS streaming formats to playback content. Azure Media Player takes into account these various formats and automatically plays the best link based on the platform/browser capabilities. Microsoft Azure Media Services also allows for dynamic encryption of assets using PlayReady encryption or AES-128 bit envelope encryption. When appropriately configured with capable platforms, Azure Media Player allows for decryption of PlayReady and AES-128 bit encrypted content. Please note that Azure Media Player only supports media streams from Azure Media Services.</p>\n\n<h2>Try it now!</h2>\n\n<p>Visit <a href=\"https://aka.ms/azuremediaplayer\">https://aka.ms/azuremediaplayer</a> to see a working, interactive, demo of the player.&nbsp; See the power of Azure Media Player by accessing the site from your PC, Mac, and popular mobile devices!

Azure Media Player is easy to set up. It only takes a few moments to get basic playback of media content from your Azure Media Services account.</p>\n\n<h3>Step 1: Add the CDN hosted player scripts to the &lt;head&gt; of your HTML page</h3>\n\n<p>Simply paste the following scripts in the &lt;head&gt; section of your HTML page.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n&lt;link href=&quot;//amp.azure.net/libs/amp/1.3.0/skins/amp-default/azuremediaplayer.min.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;\n&lt;script src= &quot;//amp.azure.net/libs/amp/1.3.0/azuremediaplayer.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n</pre>\n\n<p>As Azure Media Player evolves, there will be different versions available.&nbsp; To get access to the latest version, simply change &ldquo;1.3.0&rdquo; in the above to the latest player version.&nbsp; Player versions can be obtained <a href=\"https://amp.azure.net/libs/amp/latest/docs/changelog.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Step 2: Add the HTML video tag to your page</h3>\n\n<p>Next, simply use the &lt;video&gt; element as you normally would in the &lt;body&gt; of your HTML page. Make sure to add the following classes to the &lt;video&gt; element: &quot;azuremediaplayer amp-default-skin amp-big-play-centered&quot; which are necessary for the UI.&nbsp; Non-standard HTML &lt;video&gt; element attributes can be added through the additional data-setup attribute containing options in a valid JSON object.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n&lt;video id=&quot;azuremediaplayer&quot; class=&quot;azuremediaplayer amp-default-skin amp-big-play-centered&quot; controls autoplay width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; poster=&quot;&quot; data-setup=&#39;{&quot;nativeControlsForTouch&quot;: false}&#39; tabindex=&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;source src=&quot;https://amssamples.streaming.mediaservices.windows.net/91492735-c523-432b-ba01-faba6c2206a2/AzureMediaServicesPromo.ism/manifest&quot; type=&quot;application/vnd.ms-sstr+xml&quot; /&gt;\n        &lt;p class=&quot;amp-no-js&quot;&gt;To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/video&gt;</pre>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s it! You can now stream your videos on your webpage. Wasn&rsquo;t that simple? To see a live example of the above, click <a href=\"https://amp.azure.net/libs/amp/latest/samples/videotag_setsource.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>\n\n<p>You might be asking, <em>I only specified a SMOOTH streaming url, how can it be playing everywhere?</em> Azure Media Player utilizes its knowledge of Azure Media Services, and automatically rewrites the URL to correctly playback DASH, SMOOTH and HLS formats depending on the device/browser capabilities. That means no extra work for you!</p>\n\n<h2>Alternative Setup for dynamically loaded HTML using JavaScript</h2>\n\n<p>You can also dynamically load Azure Media Player using JavaScript.&nbsp; This example below shows how to initialize the player with an existing video tag, but you can even dynamically load the video tag into the DOM and then initialize the player.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"prettyprint\">\n&lt;video id=&quot;azuremediaplayer&quot; class=&quot;azuremediaplayer amp-default-skin amp-big-play-centered&quot;&gt; &lt;/video&gt;\n&lt;script&gt;\n  var myOptions = {\n    &quot;nativeControlsForTouch&quot;: false,\n    autoplay: true,\n    controls: true,\n    width: &quot;640&quot;,\n    height: &quot;400&quot;,\n    poster: &quot;&quot;\n  };\n  var myPlayer = amp(&quot;azuremediaplayer&quot;, myOptions);\n  myPlayer.src([\n    {src: &quot;https://amssamples.streaming.mediaservices.windows.net/91492735-c523-432b-ba01-faba6c2206a2/AzureMediaServicesPromo.ism/manifest&quot;, type: &quot;application/vnd.ms-sstr+xml&quot;}, \n  ]);\n&lt;/script&gt;</pre>\n\n<p>Using the instance myPlayer, you can now access all the JavaScript APIs for a more advanced features.
