I can recommend this service to everyone looking for enterprise-grade static content hosting on Azure.&rdquo;&mdash;Patrick Lamber, CEO, EasyLife 365</p>\n\n<p>This new feature includes enhanced protection against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, significantly reduces latency, and helps increase throughput for your global users.</p>\n\n<h2>Improve page speed</h2>\n\n<p>Today, with Azure Static Web Apps, when a user visits your site, our HTTP load balancer will determine the closest node to their location and serve your application from there. If any of our global regions is down, we intelligently re-route your user&#39;s requests to the closest healthy node in the network. This enables you to build your application resiliently across regions, failover instantly, and offer your users an &quot;always-on&quot; website availability. Enabling the enterprise-grade edge further increases your global presence by caching your website&rsquo;s static content across 118+ points of presence (POP) across 100 metro cities. As a result, your app runs with lower latency and higher throughput to your end-users.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/ce4b4ddf-0934-425e-8786-6243fa9b9d94.png\"><img alt=\"Load test for static site with enterprise-grade edge enabled\" border=\"0\" height=\"418\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/f25cde40-2d62-4f76-bb32-b0fe731c0d2c.png\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"Load test for static site with enterprise-grade edge enabled\" width=\"601\"></a></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Load test for a static site with enterprise-grade edge enabled.</em></p>\n\n<p>Faster page loads will not only improve your user&#39;s experience but will also have a positive impact on your search engine rankings and ultimately result in higher user conversion.</p>\n\n<h2>Secure your applications on a globally deployed network</h2>\n\n<p>As the number of users you serve increases, so do the chances of malicious attacks like DDoS. Enabling your applications on an enterprise-grade edge can prevent attackers from reaching your application and affecting your application&#39;s availability and performance. The full scale and capacity of our globally deployed network provide defense against common network layer attacks through always-on traffic monitoring and real-time mitigation.</p>\n\n<p>With this feature enabled, you run your websites on top of Microsoft&rsquo;s global application and content delivery network that has been running the most significant web workloads for many years, ensuring its resiliency and self-recovery capabilities. Global services like Azure DevOps, LinkedIn, and Xbox Live run on top of it and deliver blazing fast and reliable application experience.</p>\n\n<p>Our enterprise-grade edge is a zero-config cloud content delivery service that includes CDN and application acceleration. Once you enable this feature for your production applications, we will migrate your live traffic to our enhanced global distributed network with no downtime.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/2cf7579e-fa53-41d8-8554-ccdec6cef0fa.png\"><img alt=\"Enable enterprise-grade edge using the Azure Portal\" border=\"0\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/6e08b115-49b6-4197-9faf-36ebdcb5a7e6.png\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"Enable enterprise-grade edge using the Azure Portal\" width=\"601\"></a></p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Enable enterprise-grade edge using the Azure portal.</em></p>\n\n<p>With this new feature, Azure Static Web Apps streamlines everything you need to deliver the most secure and fastest experience for your users.
