    "Title": "An introduction to Azure Analysis Services on Microsoft Mechanics",
    "Summary": "Last year in October we released the preview of Azure Analysis Services, which is built on the proven analytics engine in Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services. With Azure Analysis Services you can host semantic data models in the cloud. Users in your organization can then connect to your data models using tools like Excel, Power BI, and many others to create reports and perform ad-hoc data analysis. I joined Jeremy Chapman on Microsoft Mechanics to discuss the benefits of Analysis Services in Azure.",
