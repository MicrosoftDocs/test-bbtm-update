    "Content": "<p>We&rsquo;re excited to announce Azure Media Services now offers Google Widevine license delivery service in the cloud. Today, in order to deliver Digital Rights Management(DRM) protected content across full range of browsers and devices via HTML5 Encrypted Media Extensions (EME), you will need to support more than one DRM.

Google Widevine Modular can be played on Android devices (4.3+), Chrome browser via Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) and Chromecast/Android TV. Azure Media Services now provides pay-as-you-go Widevine license delivery services. It is free at public preview and will be charged at $0.2/100 license when our service hits GA. Additionally, effective January 1 2016, PlayReady License Delivery will be reduced to $.20 per 100 licenses as well!</p>\n\n<p>The below diagram shows how you can use Google Widevine license services with the rest of Azure Media Services workflow.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/7df5a503-0958-4ceb-b991-7646ab46ebb3.png\"><img alt=\"Widevine_Architecture\" border=\"0\" height=\"303\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/5eb09dab-53ca-4859-a350-eb9925e01718.png\" style=\"border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto\" title=\"Widevine_Architecture\" width=\"640\"></a></p>\n\n<h2>Steps involved when configuring an end-to-end multi-DRM DASH stream</h2>\n\n<ul>\n <li>Encode your media asset once into H.264 multiple bitrate MP4.</li>\n <li>Azure Media Services will dynamically encrypt your content using Common encryption (CENC) and package it with PlayReady and/or Widevine license header based on your configuration.</li>\n <li>Azure Media Services delivers MPEG-DASH stream with PlayReady and/or Widevine.</li>\n <li>Use Azure Media Player to deliver the stream to your web viewers and it will detect your browser and request the allowed license type, such as Widevine for Chrome.</li>\n <li>Azure Media Services provides out-of-box Token authentication on your license delivery if you want to restrict the audiences based on your specific business logic.</li>\n <li>Azure Media Services supports both live and video-on-demands stream with Widevine.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How can I get started?</h2>\n\n<ul>\n <li>Sign up with Azure.com and <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/media-services-create-account/\">create an Azure Media Services account</a>.</li>\n <li>To configure this service using <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/windowsazure.mediaservices/3.5.2\">.NET SDK</a>, <a href=\"https://mingfeiy.com/using-net-sdk-configure-widevine-license-delivery-azure-media-services\">this MSDN tutorial</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/Azure-Samples/media-services-dotnet-dynamic-encryption-with-drm\">sample code project</a> will help you prepare a Widevine license service and configure your asset to be dynamically encrypted with Widevine.
