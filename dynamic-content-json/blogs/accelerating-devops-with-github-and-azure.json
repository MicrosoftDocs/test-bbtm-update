    "Summary": "With GitHub and Azure DevOps, Microsoft is helping developers plan, build and ship any app, from large enterprise solutions to open source projects.",
    "Content": "<p>Building better apps, faster, is a key enabler of digital transformation for every company. Many businesses are facing external pressures to be more agile, and this in turn is putting more demands on development and operations teams to increase the velocity of building and delivering digital solutions. This is where DevOps practices, starting from agile development methodologies, can help.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft is committed to helping all teams with DevOps - from developers working in small, distributed teams in the open source world to enterprises operating at scale to achieve more. Today, over 10,000 open source projects such as CPython, Pandas, and OptiKey rely on GitHub and <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/\">Azure DevOps</a> to collaborate and accelerate the pace of project innovation. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu_4pBV4ZqQ\">Watch this video to hear from developers</a> working on the Pandas project. Large enterprises like Royal Dutch Shell rely heavily on software to drive business growth and use GitHub and Azure DevOps to realize business agility at scale. More than 2,800 developers at Shell collaborate using GitHub to ship apps and AI models with Azure DevOps, targeting cloud, on-premises systems and edge devices.</p>\n\n<p>These are just a few examples of customers improving their DevOps practices supported by GitHub and Azure DevOps. We continue to innovate to make our DevOps services even easier and more productive. We&rsquo;re excited to announce new innovations to help our customers build better apps, faster.</p>\n\n<p><strong>GitHub and Azure DevOps:</strong></p>\n\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n <li style=\"margin-bottom: 2px;\">Unified Pipelines with YAML-defined CI/CD</li>\n <li style=\"margin-bottom: 2px;\">Azure Pipeline Integration with Azure Kubernetes Service</li>\n <li style=\"margin-bottom: 2px;\">Simplified Purchasing for Azure DevOps</li>\n <li style=\"margin-bottom: 2px;\">Active Directory Support for GitHub Enterprise</li>\n <li style=\"margin-bottom: 2px;\">Sign in to Azure and Azure DevOps with your GitHub account</li>\n <li style=\"margin-bottom: 2px;\">Visual Studio Subscriptions and GitHub Enterprise</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>App Center:</strong></p>\n\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\n <li>Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) integration</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>GitHub and Azure DevOps</h2>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s been less than a year since Microsoft acquired GitHub, the largest developer community on the planet, with over 36 million developers from nearly every country. GitHub is at the heart of the open source community and will always be an open platform that supports all developers. And, we&rsquo;re listening, responding to developer feedback and delivering over 100 new features in the last six months.</p>\n\n<p>Building solutions that developers love while also meeting the needs of enterprises is a core principle of our DevOps services investments. Together, GitHub and Azure DevOps provides an end-to-end experience for development teams to easily collaborate, build and release code to Azure, on-premises or any cloud.</p>\n\n<h3>Unified Pipelines with YAML-defined CI/CD</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/pipelines/\">Azure Pipelines</a>, a core part of Azure DevOps, allows for the creation of Continuous Integration in a declarative way using YAML documents. With our new updates, development teams can now leverage the same YAML documents to build multi-stage pipelines-as-code for both Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. This was one of the biggest requests from our customers. Adding the ability to create deployment pipelines with YAML files and store them in source control helps drive a tighter feedback loop between development and operation teams, relying on clear, readable documents.</p>\n\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2091040\">YAML-defined CI/CD</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Pipelines integration with Kubernetes</h3>\n\n<p>Not only have we made it simple to collaborate around CI/CD pipelines, Azure Pipelines can now be easily integrated with Kubernetes clusters. Connect to <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service/\">Azure Kubernetes Service</a> with only a few clicks, or connect to Kubernetes running on-premises or on any public cloud. Azure Pipelines analyzes your repository and suggests the right set of YAML templates to configure your pipeline and all the required Kubernetes manifest files for deploying to the cluster. Improving diagnostics by providing rich information of your pod details such as logs, container images running on the pods and the image detail view. This rich capability can target any Kubernetes environment such as Azure Kubernetes Service, Amazon EKS and Red Hat OpenShift.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/0efac641-b2b5-409a-b3b0-e3f19eab8081.png\"><img alt=\"A screenshot of Azure Pipelines showing details of a Kubernetes deployment\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/853c42a7-774a-44db-bef0-e2d0853ef1b2.png\" style=\"border: 1px solid #323237; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: block; background-image: none; max-width:90%;\" title=\"A screenshot of Azure Pipelines showing details of a Kubernetes deployment\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/languages/aks-template?view=azure-devops\">Azure Pipelines and Kubernetes</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Simplified Purchasing for Azure DevOps</h3>\n\n<p>Based on feedback, we have simplified how you license and pay for Azure DevOps capabilities.
