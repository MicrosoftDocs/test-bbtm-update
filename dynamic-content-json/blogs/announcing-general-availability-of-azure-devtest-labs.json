    "Content": "<p>Today, we are very excited to announce the general availability of <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devtest-lab/\"><u>Azure DevTest Labs</u></a>: your self-service sandbox environment in Azure to quickly create dev/test environments while minimizing waste and controlling costs.</p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ve been hearing from a lot of customers about all kinds of challenges they&rsquo;ve been facing in their dev/test environments. With the power of cloud, some problems have started being solved such as the hardware maintenance cost. On the other hand, there are still a few problems many customers have to deal with day-to-day, especially:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>Delays in delivering environments to developers/testers introduced by the traditional environment request model</li>\n <li>Time-consuming environment configuration</li>\n <li>Production fidelity issues</li>\n <li>High cost associated with cloud resource management</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img border=\"0\" height=\"118\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/9281a667-ae2d-4980-8937-c99d4acda3ca.png\" width=\"610\"><br>\n<em>Figure 1: The traditional &ldquo;request&rdquo; model introduces delays in delivering environments</em></p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s why we build Azure DevTest Labs, where you can get your fast, easy and lean dev/test environments specifically for your team and on demand.</p>\n\n<p>Azure DevTest Labs addresses the problems in dev/test environments today the following ways:</p>\n\n<h3>Be &ldquo;ready to test&rdquo; quickly</h3>\n\n<p>Flexibly define the VM bases through three different ways to boost your environment provisioning: Azure Marketplace images, custom images (your own VHD) and formulas (a reusable base where VM creation settings, such as VM image + VM sizes + virtual network etc., are pre-defined). Reusable artifacts in DevTest Labs allow users to run VM extensions and install tools, deploy applications or execute custom actions on demand once a lab VM is created.</p>\n\n<p><img height=\"360\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/65504eec-4f4d-440b-a2cd-6c0f7cb3164c.png\" v:shapes=\"_x0000_i1025\" width=\"305\"><br>\n<em>Figure 2: What makes up a formula</em></p>\n\n<h3>Worry-free self-service</h3>\n\n<p>The lab policies and the Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model in the lab enables a sandbox environment for developers and testers to provision their own environments without unexpected accidents that can introduce a big bill.</p>\n\n<p><img height=\"209\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/623a1822-a3b5-4fe0-90ae-78c8fb9d3460.png\" v:shapes=\"_x0000_i1025\" width=\"211\"><br>\n<em>Figure 3: RBAC model between subscription Owner, lab Owner and DevTest Labs user</em></p>\n\n<h3>Create once, use everywhere</h3>\n\n<p>ARM templates are fully supported to deploy labs and resources in a lab. Reusable custom images and formulas can be created from an existing VM, and artifacts loaded from VSTS Git or GitHub repositories can be used cross different labs.</p>\n\n<p><img height=\"299\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/212e5ca3-3b76-4bc6-b473-39c71aff07a2.png\" style=\"display: inline;\" v:shapes=\"_x0000_i1025\" width=\"610\"><br>\n<em>Figure 4: Create a custom image from an existing lab VM</em></p>\n\n<h3>Integrates with your existing tool chain</h3>\n\n<p>In addition to APIs and command line tools, <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuredevtestlabs.tasks\"><u>Azure DevTest Labs Tasks</u></a> are available in Visual Studio Marketplace to better support your release pipeline in Visual Studio Team Services. There are three tasks that allow you respectively to create a lab VM to run the tests, save the VM with the latest bits as a golden image, and delete the VM when it&rsquo;s no longer needed after the testing is done.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"VSTS tasks\" border=\"0\" height=\"305\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/f5135ba0-e4fe-4011-927a-b115ddd96983.jpeg\" width=\"610\"><br>\n<em>Figure 5: DevTest Labs Tasks in Visual Studio Team Services</em></p>\n\n<p>You can get a high-level idea around these four aspects in three minutes by watching the video <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/videos/what-is-azure-devtest-labs/\"><u><em>What is Azure DevTest Labs</em></u></a> or, read our <a href=\"https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devtestlab/2016/05/25/announcing-general-availability-of-azure-devtest-labs/\"><u>official announcement</u></a> at the Azure DevTest Labs Team Blog for more details.</p>\n\n<p>Try <a href=\"https://aka.ms/dtl\"><u>Azure DevTest Labs</u></a> today, and let us know what you think about it!
