    "Content": "<p>A storm hits.&nbsp; Trees down power lines, water levels rise.&nbsp; Emergency teams scramble to figure out the damage, who&rsquo;s vulnerable? First responders think visually so answering these questions often starts with a map.&nbsp; And those maps are frequently powered by <a href=\"https://www.esri.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Esri</a>, a leader in Geographic Information Systems (GIS).&nbsp; A couple weeks ago I visited their Redlands, CA headquarters on what just happened to be the day after Hurricane Sandy hit the Eastern seaboard.&nbsp; Historically GIS solutions have been delivered as complicated desktop apps, which required <em>trained GIS</em> <em>specialists</em> to use.&nbsp; But for about a year now Esri has included a cloud-based component to the system called <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/home/\" target=\"_blank\">ArcGIS Online</a>.&nbsp; It lets users, even laymen like you and me, create and instantly publish and share interactive maps.&nbsp; During the storm they experienced an intense spike in demand.&nbsp; The system scaled 3x in one day going from 50 million maps to 150 million just after the peak of the storm, all hosted on Windows Azure.&nbsp; To learn more about how cloud is affecting their industry, I chatted with Russ Johnson, Esri&rsquo;s Director of Public Safety and National Security Solutions, as well as Paul Ross, Product Manager for ArcGIS Online.&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>The past&hellip;</strong></p>  <p>Before joining Esri, Russ used to be a Commander in National Incident Response teams.&nbsp; He described how knowing what was in place before the disaster is so critical, especially when leading a diverse team that spans local, state and federal organizations.&nbsp; This information would typically be printed and distributed to emergency workers.&nbsp; One of the biggest challenges was to find the data, because local government is often in disarray due to the disaster.&nbsp; For Sept 11th it took at least a week to find the data, bring it together, normalize it, create a database, then produce maps.&nbsp; Once maps were produced people came out of the woodwork with asks.&nbsp; &ldquo;What bridges can carry big loads?&nbsp; What government buildings are vacant, damaged, etc&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>  <p>After initial assignments are made, you typically plan and refresh every twelve hours.&nbsp; That could require four to five hours in a helicopter surveying the incident.&nbsp; Then a couple hours with the planning team to generate and print new assignments for the response teams.&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>The present&hellip;</strong></p>  <p>Enter the cloud which is beginning to fundamentally change a thirty year process in a couple of key ways.&nbsp; First there&rsquo;s access to unbelievable amounts of quality base data already online. &nbsp;Then there&rsquo;s ease of use &ndash; the new app allows people to quickly create maps almost anyone can use, no specialists required.&nbsp; And instead of printed maps, or at best converted to static PDFs and then posted online, now data and intelligence is coming in real time, maps are dynamically updating - you can get the current status of roads, gas stations, shelters.&nbsp; These maps can be almost <em>instantaneously accurate</em> and easily shared broadly, across multiple agencies. Resource assignments can be made digitally and sent directly to emergency responders.&nbsp; The public can access the same maps.&nbsp; The result is more informed decisions, better outcomes, and greater continuity of governance.</p>  <p>Another new capability enabled by cloud is <em>dynamic mash ups</em>.&nbsp; For example take a map of flood zones, then bring in real time stream gauges to show current water levels.&nbsp; Or take a map of shelters and layer on the open commercial stores nearby.&nbsp; One map generates another.&nbsp; Laymen users combine static and dynamic data by themselves.&nbsp; The possibilities are endless.&nbsp; For example&hellip; here&rsquo;s a relevant question many people had - how will Superstorm Sandy affect voter turnout in the 2012 US presidential election? This <a href=\"https://www.esri.com/news/maps/2012/superstorm-sandy/election-map.html\" target=\"_blank\">map</a> took precinct-level historical voting data and overlaid FEMA impact zones for the disaster.&nbsp;</p>  <p><a href=\"\"><img src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/2500.Hurrican-Sandy.png\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"></a></p>  <p>Darker shaded counties were most damaged by the storm.&nbsp; By mashing up storm and voting data, one could assess impact of the storm on expected voter turnout by political party.</p>  <p><strong>The future&hellip;</strong></p>  <p>We&rsquo;re on the cusp of something even more powerful - crowd sourcing for damage assessment.&nbsp; Leading up to the storm, on the spur of the moment Esri created a cloud-based mobile solution allowing individuals to report and upload conditions on the ground into a central database. With the wide and growing availability of smart phones, this raises the notion of every member of the public as a possible sensor for damage assessment.&nbsp; Powerful stuff.</p>  <p>Even though we&rsquo;re not quite there yet, the cloud has already been a game changer in this industry.&nbsp; Paul Ross explained that for the first time with Hurricane Sandy there was no hesitation to use the cloud for mission critical information.&nbsp; Utility companies posted outage maps &ndash; identifying where power was out and when you can expect it to come back.&nbsp; State and local governments posted evacuation maps and impact areas.&nbsp;</p>  <p>What I find inspiring is that Esri is not just doing the same things in the cloud as they did on premises.&nbsp; They are doing things that are only possible in the cloud.&nbsp; It shows the power of software to help solve real human problems and the power of the cloud to deliver step-change improvements in how it&rsquo;s done.</p>  <p><strong>About Esri and the Microsoft Disaster Response Program</strong></p>  <p><strong>Esri</strong> and <strong>Microsoft</strong> partner to provide public and private agencies and communities information maps during disasters in a cloud computing infrastructure.&nbsp; Microsoft directs citizens to the maps via online platforms such as MSN, Bing, and Microsoft.com.</p>"
