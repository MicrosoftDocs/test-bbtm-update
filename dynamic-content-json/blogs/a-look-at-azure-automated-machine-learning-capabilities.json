    "Content": "<p>The automated machine learning capability in <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning-service/\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Machine Learning</a> service allows data scientists, analysts, and developers to build machine learning models with high scalability, efficiency, and productivity all while sustaining model quality. Automated machine learning builds a set of machine learning models automatically, intelligently selecting models for training then recommending the best one for your scenario and data set. Traditional machine learning model development is resource-intensive requiring both significant domain knowledge and time to produce and compare dozens of models.</p>\n\n<p>With the <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/new-automated-machine-learning-capabilities-in-azure-machine-learning-service/\" target=\"_blank\">announcement of automated machine learning</a> in Azure Machine Learning service as generally available last December, we have started the journey to simplify artificial intelligence (AI). This helps data scientists who want to automate part of their machine learning workflow so they can spend more time focusing on other business objectives. It also makes AI available for a wider audience of business users who don&rsquo;t have advanced data science and coding knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>We are furthering our investment for accelerating productivity with this release that includes exciting capabilities and features in the areas of model quality, improved model transparency, the latest integrations, ONNX support, a code-free user interface, time series forecasting, and product integrations.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Automated machine learning no-code web interface (preview)</h2>\n\n<p>Continuing our mission to simplify machine learning, Azure introduced the automated machine learning web user interface in Azure portal. The web user interface enables business domain experts to train models on their data, without writing a single line of code. Users can simply bring their data and, with a few clicks, start training on it. After automated machine learning comes up with the best possible model, customized to the user&rsquo;s data, they can deploy the model to Azure machine learning service as a web service to generate future predictions on new data.</p>\n\n<p>To start exploring the automated machine learning UI, simply go to <a href=\"https://portal.azure.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Azure portal</a> and navigate to an Azure machine learning workspace, where you will see &ldquo;Automated machine learning&rdquo; under the &ldquo;Authoring&rdquo; section.

Time series forecasting</h2>\n\n<p>Building forecasts is an integral part of any business, whether it&rsquo;s revenue, inventory, sales, or customer demand. Forecasting with automated machine learning is now generally available. These capabilities improve the accuracy and performance of recommended models with time series data including a predict forecast function, rolling cross validation splits for time series data, configurable lags, window aggregation, and a holiday featurizer. This ensures high accuracy forecasting models and supporting automation for machine learning across many scenarios.</p>\n\n<p>To learn more, refer to the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-auto-train-forecast\" target=\"_blank\">how to guide</a> with time series data and samples on <a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/tree/master/how-to-use-azureml/automated-machine-learning\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Model transparency</h2>\n\n<p>We understand transparency is very important for you to trust the models recommended by automated machine learning.</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>Now you can understand all steps in the machine learning pipeline including automated featurization (if you set preprocess=True). Learn more about all the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/concept-automated-ml\" target=\"_blank\">preprocessing and featurization steps</a> that automated machine learning performs. You can also programmatically understand how your input data got preprocess and featurized, what kind of scaling and normalization was done and the exact machine learning algorithm and hyperparameter values for a chosen machine learning pipeline. Follow <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-configure-auto-train\" target=\"_blank\">these steps</a> to learn more.</li>\n <li><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-configure-auto-train\" target=\"_blank\">Model interpretability</a> (feature importance) was enabled as a preview capability back in December. Since then, we have made improvements including significant performance boost.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>4. ONNX Models (preview)</h2>\n\n<p>In many enterprises, data scientists build models in Python since the popular machine learning frameworks are in Python. Many Azure Machine Learning service users also create models using Python. However, in many deployment environments, line of business applications are written in C# or Java, requiring users to &ldquo;recode&rdquo; the model. This adds a lot of friction as many times models never get deployed into production. With ONNX support, users can build ONNX models using automated machine learning and integrate with C# applications, without recoding.</p>\n\n<p>To find out more information, please visit <a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/how-to-use-azureml/automated-machine-learning/classification-with-onnx/auto-ml-classification-with-onnx.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub notebook</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>5. Enabling .NET developers using Visual Studio/VS Code (preview)</h2>\n\n<p>Empower your applications with automated machine learning while remaining in the comfort of the .NET ecosystem.
