    "Content": "<p>On February 14, 2012&nbsp; we announced significant price reductions and a new entry level database option to meet customer needs on both ends of the database spectrum.&nbsp; Today we are passing along additional savings to compute and storage customers. &nbsp;Here are the Details:</p>  <ul>  <li>Windows Azure Storage Pay-As-You-Go pricing has been reduced by 12% ($0.14 to $0.125)</li>  <li>6 Month Plans for Windows Azure Storage have been reduced across all tiers by up to 14%</li>  <li>Windows Azure Extra Small Compute has been reduced by &nbsp;50% ($.04 to .$02)</li>  </ul>  <p>With these changes, a 24x7 Extra Small Compute instance with a 100MB SQL Azure DB costs less than $20 per month. The price of compute and storage continues to be consistent across all datacenters and Pay-As-You-Go customers will automatically see the reduced prices reflected (as of today) on their next bill; there is no action required.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Customers tell us that cost savings is only part of the story.&nbsp; While we are delighted to <b>pass along savings </b>(60% reduction in XSmall compute and 17% reduction in Storage in the last 6 months), we are just as focused on <b>improving the developer experience</b> and <b>adding new capabilities</b> to ensure the best overall value in the industry.&nbsp; Storage is a great example.&nbsp; While the reduced price of $.125/GB provides cost benefits, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2011/09/15/introducing-geo-replication-for-windows-azure-storage.aspx\">Geo-Replication</a> differentiates Windows Azure Storage from other services in market. SQL Azure is another great example; $5.00/month for a 100 MB Database is great, but it&rsquo;s much more appealing to developers when it comes with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/features/sql-azure/?WT.mc_id=cmp_pst001_blg_post0068sql\">high availability</a>, fault tolerance, self-management, elastic scale-out, on-premises connectivity, and a full Service Level Agreement.</p>  <p>A few additional details:</p>  <ul>  <li>Windows Azure 3 Month Free Trial and MSDN customers will receive twice as many extra small compute instances per month vs. previous allocations</li>  <li>Additional details on pricing and pricing calculator can be found at:  <ul>  <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/details/?WT.mc_id=cmp_pst001_blg_post0068pri\">Pricing page</a></li>  <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/offers/ms-azr-0021p?WT.mc_id=cmp_pst001_blg_post0068pla\">Storage commitment offers</a></li>  <li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/?WT.mc_id=cmp_pst001_blg_post0068cal\">Pricing calculator</a></li>  </ul>  </li>  </ul>  <p>Steven Martin, General Manager, Windows Azure Business Strategy &amp; Planning</p>"
