If you have a complex service that needs to be deployed to several regions, if you&rsquo;d like greater control over when your resources are deployed in relation to one another, or if you&rsquo;d like to limit your customer&rsquo;s exposure to bad updates by catching them while in progress, then Deployment Manager is for you. Deployment Manager allows you to perform staged rollouts of resources, meaning they are deployed region by region in an ordered fashion.</p>\n\n<p>During Microsoft Build 2019, we <a href=\"https://aka.ms/admhealthblog\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that Deployment Manager now supports integrated health checks. This means that as your rollout proceeds, Deployment Manager will integrate with your existing service health monitor, and if during deployment unacceptable health signals are reported from your service, the deployment will automatically stop and allow you to troubleshoot.</p>\n\n<p>In order to make health integration as easy as possible, we&rsquo;ve been working with some of the top service health monitoring companies to provide you with a simple copy/paste solution to integrate health checks with your deployments. If you&rsquo;re not already using a health monitor, these are great solutions to start with:</p>\n\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/b67b09a6-7919-4d0f-b94d-aabae2e5f45e.png\"><img alt=\"Datadog's logo.\" border=\"0\" height=\"128\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/6002a08a-cb51-4b3c-beef-a5d22b7a064d.png\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"Datadog's logo.\" width=\"128\"></a></td>\n   <td style=\"vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/abc475c3-d67e-4a20-b860-e4ff01e52fab.png\"><img alt=\"The logo for Site 24x7.\" border=\"0\" height=\"128\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/53b965c5-e8eb-4cf4-b713-8e0156626b40.png\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"The logo for Site 24x7.\" width=\"128\"></a></td>\n   <td style=\"vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/45855326-354f-43d9-80af-7babedff99ba.png\"><img alt=\"Wavefront's logo.\" border=\"0\" height=\"128\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/7c7ee3b6-e59f-4d03-87b3-cce89082228a.png\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"Wavefront's logo.\" width=\"128\"></a></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"vertical-align: middle;\">Datadog, the leading monitoring and analytics platform for modern cloud environments.
