To be successful in using AI, healthcare needs solutions, not projects. Learn how you can close the gap to your AI in healthcare solution by accelerating your initiative using Microsoft Azure blueprints.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>To rapidly acquire new capabilities and implement new solutions, healthcare IT and developers can now take advantage of industry-specific Azure Blueprints. Blueprints include resources such as example code, test data, security, and compliance support. These are packages that include reference architectures, guidance, how-to guides and other documentation, and may also include executable code and sample test data built around a key use case of interest to healthcare organizations. Blueprints also contain components to support privacy, security, and compliance initiatives, including threat models, security controls, responsibility matrices, and compliance audit reports.</p>\n\n<p>Using these blueprints, your healthcare IT team can quickly implement a new type of solution in your secure Azure cloud. <strong>With a blueprint, however, you get 50 percent to 90 percent of the end solution. Then, you can simply devote your efforts and resources to customizing the blueprint solution.</strong></p>\n\n<p>You can learn more by watching the <a href=\"https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Finfopedia.eventbuilder.com%2Fevent%3FWT.mc_id%3Daccel-acomblog-dastarr%26eventid%3Du1w1q8&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7Ce40aaf53c86044b3c24f08d608872bfc%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636705773991869328&amp;sdata=1KsHwakNO4RNOvA6DTnh02CwmZQjrfcO%2F4GoKOBLyyI%3D&amp;reserved=0\" target=\"_blank\">Accelerating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Healthcare Using Microsoft Azure Blueprints Webcast</a>.
