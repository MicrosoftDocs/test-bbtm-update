    "Content": "<p>Persistent threats like bootkits and rootkits are sophisticated malware types that run with the same kernel-mode privileges as the operating system they infect. Using those privileges, they can hide themselves from diagnostic tools and antimalware, making them extremely difficult to detect and almost impossible to remove. That foothold is typically leveraged by malware to bypass local logins, record passwords and keystrokes, exfiltrate private files, and steal security keys and credentials.</p>\n\n<p>Today, <a href=\"https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FCQqu_rTSi0Q&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cv-teseal%40microsoft.com%7C0150eb1e557c46664cb008d8f85aba3b%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637532415841224309%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=N3aIJO9pO7s1j1JVlhHLa0Q2x7nsq7%2BloW4RXQi%2FXCU%3D&amp;reserved=0\" target=\"_blank\">I&#39;m announcing that Azure customers can prevent bootkit and rootkit infections</a> by enabling <a href=\"https://aka.ms/trustedlaunch\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Trusted Launch</a> for their virtual machines. Trusted Launch allows administrators to deploy virtual machines with verified and signed bootloaders, OS kernels, and a boot policy that leverages the Trusted Launch Virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) to measure and attest to whether the boot was compromised. The vTPM measurements give administrators visibility into the integrity of the entire boot process, and vTPM release policies ensure that keys, certificates, and secrets aren&#39;t accessible to compromised virtual machines.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/1b129ac3-ca0d-42b1-8fea-86c02ce6f27c.png\"><img alt=\"Azure Trusted Launch configuration screenshot\" border=\"0\" height=\"421\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/c28bd9a5-c6eb-4c8c-9537-066e8c75916c.png\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"\" width=\"1024\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Azure Security Center serves as a single pane of glass for integrity alerts, recommendations, and remediations generated by Trusted Launch. These new features are easily enabled: Trusted Launch is switched on with a simple change in deployment code or a checkbox within the Azure portal for all virtual machines.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/2cede844-2d42-4951-a553-133a0ec8c767.jpeg\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/f9636353-9b7b-4ac6-b015-6e0a9c5d96cf.jpeg\"></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.msc.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mediterranean Shipping Company</a> (MSC), one of the largest shipping companies in the world, is in the process of moving its global compute infrastructure to Azure.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\"><em>&quot;As part of migrating to Azure, we need security and compliance across all layers of the stack, especially at the bootloader and OS kernel level.
