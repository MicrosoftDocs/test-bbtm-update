    "Content": "<p>This month we released a new version of Azure Storage Explorer, 1.10.0. This latest version of Storage Explorer introduces several exciting new features and delivers significant updates to existing functionality. These features and changes are all designed to make users more efficient and productive when working with Azure Storage, CosmosDB, ADLS Gen2, and, starting with 1.10.0, managed disks. If you&rsquo;ve never used Storage Explorer before, you can download it for Windows, macOS, or Linux <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/\" target=\"_blank\">on the product page here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Storage Explorer adds support for managed disks</h2>\n\n<p>One of the most challenging parts of migrating on-premises virtual machines (VMs) to Azure is moving the data for these VMs into Azure. Storage Explorer 1.10.0 makes this process much easier by adding support for managed disks. The new features we&rsquo;ve added for managed disks lets you create and manage VM disks using the easy to use Storage Explorer GUI. Using Storage Explorer also gives you an incredibly performant workflow. When you upload a VHD to a Managed Disk, Storage Explorer is leveraging the power and speed of AzCopy v10 to quickly get your data into Azure. Storage Explorer&rsquo;s support for managed disks also includes the ability to create snapshots of, copy, download, and delete your managed disks.&nbsp;You can learn more about the latest disk support capabilities on <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/new-disk-support-capabilities-in-azure-storage-explorer/\">our recent blog.</a></p>\n\n<h2>Storage Explorer introduces new user settings</h2>\n\n<p>Ever since Storage Explorer was first released, users have asked for a variety of settings that would allow them to configure how Storage Explorer behaves. As more settings have been added though, managing and discovering these settings has proved increasingly difficult. To help alleviate those problems, we are excited to introduce a centralized settings user interface (UI.) From this UI, you can configure many of Storage Explorer&rsquo;s existing setting, such as proxy and application theme. We&rsquo;ve also added settings which allow you to logout on exit and to toggle the refresh mode of the data explorers.</p>\n\n<p>We have a long list of user requested settings in our backlog which will make their way to the settings UI in future updates. And if you have a suggestion for a setting you&rsquo;d like to see, feel free to let us know by <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/AzureStorageExplorer/issues/new/choose\" target=\"_blank\">opening an issue</a> at our GitHub repo.</p>\n\n<h2>Storage Explorer now available on the Snap Store</h2>\n\n<p>The last major change we&rsquo;d like to highlight for 1.10.0 is the addition of Storage Explorer to the Canonical Snap Store. Installing Storage Explorer on Linux has always been a challenge for users, but when you install from the Snap Store things become as easy as installing on any other platform. The Snap platform will install all dependencies for you, and help you keep Storage Explorer up to date and secure. If you&rsquo;d like to install Storage Explorer from the Snap Store, you can find it <a href=\"https://snapcraft.io/storage-explorer\" target=\"_blank\">listed on the store</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Looking forward</h2>\n\n<p>Over the coming months, we have plans to add even more new features and capabilities to Storage Explorer. In the near future, we will be making AzCopy the default transfer engine for all Blob transfers, and we&rsquo;ll start work on using AzCopy for File Shares. We&rsquo;ve also been hard at work localizing Storage Explorer into additional languages so more people all over the world can effectively use the product. We&rsquo;re going to improve on and bring additional features to ADLS Gen 2, including enhanced ACL management and increased parity with Blob features. And of course, we&rsquo;ll be looking at GitHub for any user requests for new features, so if there&rsquo;s something you would like to see then we highly encourage you to to <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/AzureStorageExplorer/issues/new/choose\" target=\"_blank\">open an issue</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Install Storage Explorer now</h2>\n\n<p>Download <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/\" target=\"_blank\">Storage Explorer 1.10.0</a> today to take advantage of all of these new features. If you have any feedback, please make sure to open a new issue on our <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/AzureStorageExplorer/issues/new/choose\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub repo</a>.
