Our goal is to offer you a productive and easy-to-use single-pane-of glass where you can build, manage, and monitor your Azure services, applications, and infrastructure.

The more you use the portal, the more it adjusts to you!</li>\n <li><strong>Common entry points and useful info (static)</strong>: the lower section contains static content with common entry points to provide quick access to main navigation flows that are always there, enabling users to develop muscle memory for repeated usage.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/c62759f8-28fc-4548-840b-b52dd20f9952.png\"><em><img title=\"Screenshot showing the new sections of the Azure home page. \" alt=\"Screenshot showing the new sections of the Azure home page. \" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/ef3d17ad-df93-4dc7-8b41-627a8d925af9.png\"></em></a></p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><em>Figure 2 – sections of the home page.</em></p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Azure services</strong> section provides quick access to the Azure Marketplace, a list of eight of the most-used Azure services, and access to browse the entire Azure offering. The list of services is populated by default with some of our most popular services and gets automatically updated with your most recently used services. The <strong>Recent resources</strong> section shows a list of your recently used resources. Both lists get updated as you use the product. Our goal is to bring relevant services and instances front and center without requiring customization. The more you use the product, the more useful it gets for you! The rest of the sections are static, providing important points of reference for navigation and access to key Azure products, services, content, and training.</p>\n\n<p>The overall home experience has been streamlined by hiding the left navigation bar under an always present menu button in the top navigation bar:</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/443b6861-db64-47bb-975f-fde52ff13845.png\"><em><img title=\"A screenshot pointing out the menu button in the Azure portal.\" alt=\"A screenshot pointing out the menu button in the Azure portal.\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/2257f4a8-a5ee-4097-b956-c53a7ec892d6.png\"></em></a></p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><em>Figure 3 – The menu button</em></p>\n\n<p>The main motivation for this change is improving focus, reducing distractions and redundancy, and to enable more immersive experiences. Before this change, when you were immersed in a workload in the portal you always had two vertical menus side by side, the left navigation bar and the menu for the experience. The left navigation bar is still available with all its functionality, including favorites, through the menu button at the top bar, always only one click away.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/747e18fd-f9cf-4453-96e9-dfebe8aca9b2.png\"><img title=\"An image comparing the new and old left navigation bars.\" alt=\"An image comparing the new and old left navigation bars.\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/925d668b-4f38-4565-b241-374d38979bab.png\"></a></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Figure 4 – The new experience allows for more focus.</p>\n\n<p>If you prefer the old visual, having the left navigation always present, you can always bring it back using the <strong>Portal Settings</strong> panel.<a name=\"Service Cards\" id=\"Service Cards\"></a></p>\n\n<h2>New service cards</h2>\n\n<p>We have added hover cards associated with each service that show contextual information and provide direct access to some of the most common workflows. These hover cards are displayed after the cursor is placed for about a second on a service tile. We used the same interaction pattern and design than Outlook uses for identities (users and groups) that are well established with our customer base.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/ded8b035-6c5e-462b-bf71-72c5b1b49bde.gif\"><img title=\"A gif of the Azure services page and the Virtual machines hover card.\" alt=\"A gif of the Azure services page and the Virtual machines hover card.\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/c60e45b1-2565-4929-ae2b-963d676d7334.gif\"></a></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Figure 5 – hover card for virtual machines.</em></p>\n\n<p>The cards expose relevant contextual information and actions for a service, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li><strong>Create an instance:</strong> this provides quick access to a very common flow, short circuiting going though intermediate screens to launch the creation.</li>\n <li><strong>Browse instances:</strong> browse the full list of instances of that service.</li>\n <li><strong>Recently used:</strong> the last three recently used instances of that service, providing direct contextual access.</li>\n <li><strong>Microsoft Learn content:</strong> specialized free training curated for that service. The curation has been done by the Microsoft Learn team based on usage data and customer feedback.</li>\n <li><strong>Links to documents:</strong> key documents to learn or use the product (quick starts, technical docs, pricing.)</li>\n <li><strong>Free offerings available:</strong> if the service has free options available, surface them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/ba0e349f-2b3a-4631-88cf-f8d21957cc3a.png\"><em><img title=\"A screenshot showing the anatomy of the Virtual machines service card.\" alt=\"A screenshot showing the anatomy of the Virtual machines service card.\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/7df59a21-fc8c-4888-b09c-5637684a32f9.png\"></em></a></p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><em>Figure 6 – Anatomy of the card</em></p>\n\n<p>The cards help improve on multiple aspects including more efficient customer journeys, better discoverability, and contextualized information, all presented in the context of one service. The card also helps customers of all levels of expertise: While new customers can benefit from Microsoft Learn content and free offerings advanced customers have a faster path the create instances or access their recently used instances of that service.</p>\n\n<p>The card does not only show on the home page. It is available in every place we display a service like the left navigation bar, the all services list, as well as the Azure home page.<a name=\"Microsoft Learn\" id=\"Microsoft Learn\"></a></p>\n\n<h2>Extended Microsoft Learn integration</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/?WT.mc_id=home_homepage-azureportal-learn\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Learn</a> provides official high-quality free learning material for Microsoft technologies. In this portal update we have introduced several contextual integration points:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li><strong>Service browsing</strong>: contextual integration at the service category level (compute, storage, web, etc.)</li>\n <li><strong>Service cards</strong>: contextual integration at the service level (virtual machine, Cosmos DB, etc.) available in Azure home page, left navigation, and service browsing experience.</li>\n <li><strong>Azure QuickStart center</strong>: integration of most popular trainings in the landing page</li>\n <li><strong>Azure home</strong>: direct access to the main Microsoft Learn entry point</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Moving forward, the Azure portal and Microsoft Learn integration will continue to grow, to help you improve your Azure journey!<a name=\"Enhanced Service Browsing\" id=\"Enhanced Service Browsing\"></a></p>\n\n<h2>Enhanced service browsing experience</h2>\n\n<p>Azure is big and gets bigger every day. Navigating through Azure’s offering in the portal can be intimidating and challenging due to the vast set of available services. To make this easier, we’ve made the following updates:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li><strong>Improved global search</strong>: improved performance and functionality when searching for services in the global search box in the top bar of the portal. This improved search is also always present and available in your portal session.</li>\n <li><strong>Improved service browsing experience</strong>: improved the <strong>All services</strong> experience adding an overview category supporting progressive disclosure of services, reducing visual clutter, and adding contextual Microsoft Learn content.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For service browsing, we introduced an overview category with the goal of progressively disclosing information.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/18fb6959-967b-4e6b-8a07-8fba17206545.png\"><img title=\"A screenshot showing the progressive disclosure of information. \" alt=\"A screenshot showing the progressive disclosure of information. \" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/20d9a6d8-8a59-4ece-8ad4-378cc20325cc.png\"></a></p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><em>Figure 7 – progressive disclosure of information and better discoverability</em></p>\n\n<p>The new <strong>Overview</strong> category presents a list of 15 of Azure’s most popular services, curated Microsoft Learn training content, and access to key functionality like Azure QuickStart center and free offerings.</p>\n\n<p>If the service that you are looking for is not available on this screen you can use the service search functionality, at the top left, or you can browse through the different categories available, at the left of the screen. When displaying a category, we are now surfacing <strong>contextual </strong>and <strong>free</strong> Microsoft Learn content to assist you in your Azure learning journey.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/934ae57e-ce94-4105-9052-e9c858ec99dc.png\"><em><img title=\"A screenshot of the service categories.\" alt=\"A screenshot of the service categories.\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/b43226cb-487f-4cc3-b600-fef387e27363.png\"></em></a></p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><em>Figure 8 – service category with contextual and free Microsoft Learn integration.

We are introducing an updated experience that leverages the power of Azure Resource Graph to provide improved performance, better filtering and sorting options, better grouping, and allows exporting your resource lists to a CSV file.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/3ca0c5f1-3dd7-40ba-96c3-0e7fe9ef5d90.png\"><em><img title=\"A screenshot showcasing the improved resource browsing experience.\" alt=\"A screenshot showcasing the improved resource browsing experience.\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/456acd0e-9ccb-45e0-a360-e54361318cce.png\"></em></a></p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><em>Figure 9 – improved resource browsing experience</em></p>\n\n<p>As of this month, this experience will be available for more than 70 services and over the next few months it will be rolled out across the entire platform.<a name=\"Improved Azure Resource Graph\" id=\"Improved Azure Resource Graph\"></a></p>\n\n<h2>Improved Azure Resource Graph experience</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/ArgQueryBlade\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Resource Graph Explorer</a> available in the portal enables you to <strong>write queries</strong> and <strong>create</strong> <strong>dashboards</strong> using the full power of Azure Resource Graph. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVlZdCOfKlU&amp;list=PLLasX02E8BPBKgXP4oflOL29TtqTzwhxR&amp;index=13&amp;t=3s\" target=\"_blank\">Here is a video</a> that shows how to use Resource Graph to write queries and create an inventory dashboard for your Azure subscriptions.</p>\n\n<p>We have now introduced <a href=\"https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResource/resourceType/Microsoft.resourcegraph%2Fqueries\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Resource Graph Queries</a> in the Azure portal as a new top-level resource.

The main reason for this change is that many customers could not find the “Language &amp; region” settings in the previous design and were asking us for capabilities that were already available in the portal.
