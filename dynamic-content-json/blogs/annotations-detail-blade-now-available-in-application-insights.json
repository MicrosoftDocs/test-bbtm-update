    "Summary": "Good news, the detail blade for the Annotations feature in Application Insights is now available!",
    "Content": "<p>In my <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/application-insights-announces-availability-of-release-annotations/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Release Annotations blog post\">last blog post</a>, I announced the availability of a new feature in Application Insights called <em>Annotations.</em> I also mentioned a detail blade for this feature would become available over the next couple of sprints. Well, good news, everybody: it&rsquo;s available <em>now</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The functionality is as simple as possible: just click on the Annotation for which you&rsquo;d like to view the detail, and the new blade will open to the right. This blade provides a myriad of information about the release, including the release id, requestor, source control branch, release definition, and environment, among others. Here&rsquo;s a quick shot of it in action:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"image\" border=\"0\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/fc9e824e-85eb-4fe9-a920-4ab56d4fd8c0.png\" style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border-image: none\" title=\"image\" width=\"610\"></p>\n\n<p>With the addition of this functionality, we feel that this brings much more value to Release Annotations. It&rsquo;s now possible to obtain more identifying information very quickly when trying to correlate releases to your telemetry in Application Insights.</p>\n\n<p>The App Insights ALM team hopes that this addition makes Annotations more useful in your daily monitoring and analysis of your web apps and services. If you have additional associated release data that&rsquo;s not on the detail blade that you would like to see, please let us know and we&rsquo;ll investigate the availability of the data.</p>\n\n<p>We have more coming for you very soon, so please keep an eye on my posts here on the Azure blog for new announcements!</p>\n\n<p>As always, please share your ideas for new or improved features at the Application Insights User Voice page and for any questions visit the <a href=\"https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/home?forum=ApplicationInsights\"><u>Application Insights Forum</u></a>.</p>\n<script>\n  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n  (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n  m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n  })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n\n  ga('create', 'UA-68318793-1', 'auto');\n  ga('send', 'pageview');\n\n</script>"
