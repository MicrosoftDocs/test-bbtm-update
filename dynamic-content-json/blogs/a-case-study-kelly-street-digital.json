    "Content": "<p>[This article was contributed by the SQL Azure team.]</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>In 2008, Glen Knowles founded Kelly Street Digital and created  Campaign Taxi, an application available by subscription that helps customers  track consumer interactions across multiple marketing campaigns. Campaign Taxi  features an application programming interface (API) that customers can use to  easily set up digital campaigns, add functionality to their websites, store  consumer information in a single database, and present the data in reports.&nbsp; Kelly Street Digital uses both Windows Azure  and SQL Azure as a foundation for their solution.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Kelly Street Digital used to run their solution on Amazon  AWS until mid-2010.&nbsp; They <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/casestudies/Case_Study_Detail.aspx?CaseStudyID=4000009046\">switched  to the Windows Azure</a> platform after running a successful pilot.&nbsp; The company migrated the application in six  short weeks with a single developer and can now deploy updates of their  application in in minutes.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><i>\"With Windows Azure,  you press a button to test the application in the staging environment,\" says  Knowles. \"Then you press another button to put the application into production  in the cloud. It's seamless.\"</i></p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>When Kelly Street Digital migrated from SQL Server to SQL  Azure a developer wrote a single script that ported their data to SQL  Azure.&nbsp; Since then, they use Windows  Azure Blob storage to backup their SQL Azure data to the cloud, never  experiencing any data loss since the move.&nbsp;  The greatest benefit yet, Kelly Street Digital is now saving over $4,000  a month since migrating to the Windows Azure Platform.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>  <ul class=\"unIndentedList\">  <li>  Decreased Costs<strong></strong></li>  <li>  Increased Speed<strong></strong></li>  <li>  Tightly integrated technologies<strong></strong></li>  <li>  Improved reliability<strong></strong></li>  <li>  Enhanced scalability<strong></strong></li>  </ul>  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>  <p><strong>Software</strong></p>  <ul class=\"unIndentedList\">  <li>  Windows Azure</li>  <li>  Microsoft SQL Azure</li>  <li>  Windows Azure Platform</li>  <li>  Microsoft Visual Studio 2010</li>  <li>  Microsoft Visual Studio Team Foundation Server  2010</li>  <li>  Microsoft .NET Framework</li>  </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>It's a great example of what partners of ours are doing to  offer new capabilities to their customers with the cloud.</p>  <p>  To read the entire case study and learn more, go  <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/casestudies/Case_Study_Detail.aspx?CaseStudyID=4000009046\">here</a>.&nbsp; Thanks!&nbsp;</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>"
