    "Content": "<p>It has been inspiring to watch how customers use Azure Stack to innovate and drive digital transformation across cloud boundaries. In her blog post today, Julia White shares examples of <a href=\"https://aka.ms/Microsoftdelivershybridinnovation\" target=\"_blank\">how customers are using Azure Stack to innovate on-premises using Azure services</a>. Azure Stack shipped in 2017, and it is the only solution in the market today for customers to run cloud applications using consistent IaaS and PaaS services across public cloud, on-premises, and in disconnected environments. While customers love the fact that they can run cloud applications on-premises with Azure Stack, we understand that most customers also run important parts of their organization on traditional virtualized applications. Now we have a new option to deliver cloud efficiency and innovation for these workloads as well.</p>\n\n<p>Today, I am pleased to announce<strong> Azure Stack HCI solutions</strong> are available for customers who want to run virtualized applications on modern hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) to lower costs and improve performance. Azure Stack HCI solutions feature the same software-defined compute, storage, and networking software as Azure Stack, and can integrate with Azure for hybrid capabilities such as cloud-based backup, site recovery, monitoring, and more.</p>\n\n<p>Adopting hybrid cloud is a journey and it is important to have a strategy that takes into account different workloads, skillsets, and tools. Microsoft is the only leading cloud vendor that delivers a comprehensive set of hybrid cloud solutions, so customers can use the right tool for the job without compromise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>Choose the right option for each workload</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/6ececfa8-fff4-4ec3-8433-3e05e5bbf815.png\"><img alt=\"Azure Stack HCI solutions\" border=\"0\" height=\"535\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/0a7ddadb-5bbd-4d85-bff5-4193da82068f.png\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; display: inline; background-image: none;\" title=\"Azure Stack HCI solutions\" width=\"1886\"></a></p>\n\n<h2>Azure Stack HCI: Use existing skills, gain hyperconverged efficiency, and connect to Azure</h2>\n\n<p>Azure Stack HCI solutions are designed to run virtualized applications on-premises in a familiar way, with simplified access to Azure for hybrid cloud scenarios.
