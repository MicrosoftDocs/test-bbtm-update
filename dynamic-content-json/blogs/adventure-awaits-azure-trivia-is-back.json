Can I still win this week?</strong></p>\n\n<p>No, unfortunately only correct answers are valid entries. But you can try again next week!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Am I eligible to win?</strong></p>\n\n<p>You need to be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>A legal resident of the 50 U.S. states (and the District of Columbia)</li>\n\t<li>18 years of age or older</li>\n\t<li>If you&rsquo;re under 18, you need to have consent of a parent or legal guardian</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You cannot be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>An employee or a family member of an employee of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries, affiliates, advertising agencies, and sweepstakes parties</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>How many winners are there each week?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ll randomly select 10 lucky winners each week.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When do you announce the answer?</strong></p>\n\n<p>We&rsquo;ll announce the answer on Friday morning each week. Check the @Azure feed to find out if you got it right.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do I find out if I won?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Check your mentions on Fridays!

You can use #AzureTrivia as much as you want, but multiple tweets within the weekly entry period will not increase your chances of winning.</p>\n\n<p>*No purchase necessary.
