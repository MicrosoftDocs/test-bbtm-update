    "Summary": "App Service is a new, one-of-a kind cloud service that enables developers to build web and mobile apps for any platform and any device.",
    "Content": "In a mobile first, cloud first world, companies need to ensure their customers, partners and employees are able to seamlessly connect with and consume data across anywhere and on any device. As a developer, you need to build applications that support multiple platforms, can integrate with on-premises information systems and cloud-based services as well as automatically scale globally as your business and audience grow. That’s why today, on behalf of the entire Application Platform team, I'm excited to announce Azure App Service.\n\nApp Service is a new, one-of-a kind cloud service that enables developers to build web and mobile apps for any platform and any device. App Service is an integrated solution that streamlines development while enabling easy integration with on-premises and SaaS systems while providing the ability to quickly automate business processes.\n<h3>Unique Integrated Offering</h3>\nAzure App Service brings together the capabilities from Azure Websites, Azure Mobile Services, and Azure BizTalk Services into a unique integrated offering, while adding powerful new features. App Service includes the following app types:\n<ul>\n <li>Web Apps - Create mission critical Web apps that scale with your business.</li>\n <li>Mobile Apps - Engage employees, partners and customers on any device at any time.</li>\n <li>Logic Apps - Automate business processes across SaaS and on-premises.</li>\n <li>API Apps - Easily build and consume Cloud APIs within any app.</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/blogmedia/blogmedia/2015/03/23/App-Service.png\"><img style=\"padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"App Service\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/App-Service_thumb.png\" alt=\"App Service\" width=\"894\" height=\"894\" border=\"0\" /></a>\n\nLet’s take a look at each app type in more detail…\n<h3>Web Apps</h3>\n<a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-web-overview/\">Web Apps</a> allow you host any website, web app, and API in the cloud. If you are an existing Azure Websites customer, all of your existing web apps run as-is in App Service with zero changes needed and continue to enjoy the same SLA. You also have access to all of the other app types and features at no additional cost. Your existing web hosting plan, now the app hosting plan, is able to also run mobile, logic and api apps at the exact same price!\n\nWeb Apps provide a robust set of developer centric capabilities such as support for multiple languages and frameworks (.NET, Java, PHP, NodeJS, Python, and more), Continuous Integration and cloud debugging. Web Apps empower enterprises through specific capabilities like hybrid connectivity and Active Directory integration while making sure compliance, auditing and data retention requirements are met. Web Apps can auto-scale to meet any needs, and offer high-availability through deployment in several geo-locations with Azure Traffic Manager.\n\n<a href=\"https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/blogmedia/blogmedia/2015/03/23/Level-3.png\"><img style=\"padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"Level 3\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/Level-3_thumb.png\" alt=\"Level 3\" width=\"679\" height=\"784\" border=\"0\" /></a>\n<h3>Mobile Apps</h3>\n<a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-value-prop-preview/\">Mobile Apps </a>offer a mobile application development platform with a rich set of capabilities.

With API Apps, developers can select from a rich library of existing on-premises and cloud APIs as well as contribute their own APIs easily for public or private use by Logic, Web, and Mobile apps in Azure App Service.\n\nAPI Apps provide versioning capabilities for you APIs making it easy to manage new versions and automatically update the applications that use them in real time without downtime. APIs can be consumed in a variety of programming languages with tooling that generates SDKs in all the languages supported in App Service (.NET, Node.js, Java, PHP and Python). Determine who can access APIs with simple controls to require authenticated users, public users or just other apps inside App Service. Protect APIs with enterprise grade security using Active Directory including single sign on and social identity using Google, Twitter, Facebook and Microsoft accounts. Consume third party services with built in support for OAuth and a secure token store to store access credentials with no coding. API Apps provide a tightly integrated development experience ranging from the VS IDE to the cloud with tools like cloud debugging, live tracing and Testing in Production (TiP).\n\n<a href=\"https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/blogmedia/blogmedia/2015/03/23/API.png\"><img style=\"padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"API\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/API_thumb.png\" alt=\"API\" width=\"1263\" height=\"768\" border=\"0\" /></a>\n<h3>Developer Agility</h3>\nAzure App Service is backed by a common development, management and billing model that’s easy to understand, allowing you to rapidly develop, deploy and scale powerful web and mobile apps.\n\nWith App Service, developers enjoy the following benefits:\n<ul>\n <li>Deploy web, mobile and API apps in seconds using your language of choice like .NET, Java, NodeJS, PHP or Python</li>\n <li>Build one app backend that works across native iOS, Android and Windows clients</li>\n <li>Automate business processes using a powerful new visual design experience</li>\n <li>Connect easily to enterprise systems such as SQL, SAP and Oracle and popular cloud services like Office 365, Dynamics CRM, Salesforce.com, DropBox and many more</li>\n <li>Build and consume cloud APIs from a rich ecosystem of connectors and templates</li>\n <li>Perform sophisticated DevOps functions with continuous integration using Visual Studio Online and GitHub</li>\n <li>Focus on rapidly improving your apps without worrying about infrastructure</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Powerful App Platform</h3>\nWith App Service, you can host any number of app types on a single App Service plan, and pay just one low price.
