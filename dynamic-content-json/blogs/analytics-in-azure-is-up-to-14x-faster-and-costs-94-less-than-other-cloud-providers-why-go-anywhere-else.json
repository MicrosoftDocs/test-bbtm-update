    "Content": "<p>It&rsquo;s true. With the volume and complexity of data rapidly increasing, performance and security are critical requirements for analytics. But not all analytics services are built equal. And not all cloud storage is built for analytics.</p>\n\n<p>Only Azure provides the most comprehensive set of analytics services from data ingestion to storage to data warehousing to machine learning and BI. Each of these services have been finely tuned to provide industry leading performance, security and ease of use, at unmatched value. In short, Azure has you covered.</p>\n\n<h2>Unparalleled price-performance</h2>\n\n<p>When it comes to analytics, price-performance is key. In July 2018, GigaOm published a study that showed that Azure SQL Data Warehouse was 67 percent faster and 23 percent cheaper than Amazon Web Service RedShift.</p>\n\n<p>That was then. Today, we&rsquo;re even better!</p>\n\n<p>In the most recent study by GigaOm, they found that Azure SQL Data Warehouse is now outperforming the competition up to a whopping <a href=\"https://aka.ms/simply-unmatched/\" target=\"_blank\">14x times</a>. No one else has produced independent, industry-accepted benchmarks like these. Not AWS Redshift or Google BigQuery. And the best part? Azure is up to <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/sql-data-warehouse/compare/\" target=\"_blank\">94 percent cheaper</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/59b66bb1-a2ae-4cbe-a351-d0cc066b80fe.png\"><img alt=\"Price performance comparison\" border=\"0\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/9a495f75-32ea-429e-b849-dcf799d476ea.png\" style=\"margin: 22px auto 0px; border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;\" title=\"Price performance comparison\" width=\"324\"></a></p>\n\n<p>This industry leading price-performance extends to the rest of our analytics stack. This includes Azure Data Lake Storage, our cloud data storage service, and Azure Databricks, our big data processing service. Customers like Newell Brands &ndash; worldwide marketer of consumer and commercial products such as Rubbermaid, Mr. Coffee and Oster &ndash; recently moved their workload to Azure and realized significant improvements.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>&ldquo;Azure Data Lake Storage will streamline our analytics process and deliver better end to end performance with lower cost.&rdquo;&nbsp; </em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"right\">&ndash; Danny Siegel, Vice President of Information Delivery Systems, Newell Brands</p>\n\n<h2>Secure cloud analytics</h2>\n\n<p>All the price-performance in the world means nothing without security. Make the comparison and you will see Azure is the most trusted cloud in the market. Azure has the most comprehensive set of compliance offerings, including more certifications than <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/trusted-cloud/\" target=\"_blank\">any other cloud vendor</a> combined with advanced identity governance and access management with <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/security-identity-management-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Active Directory</a> integration.</p>\n\n<p>For analytics, we have developed additional capabilities to meet customers&rsquo; most stringent security requirements. Azure Data Lake Storage provides multi-layered security including POSIX compliant file and folder permissions and at-rest encryption. Similarly, Azure SQL Data Warehouse utilizes machine learning to provide the most comprehensive set of security capabilities across data protection, access control, authentication, network security, and automatic threat detection.</p>\n\n<h2>Insights for all</h2>\n\n<p>What&rsquo;s the best compliment to Azure Analytics&rsquo; unmatched price-performance and security? The answer is Microsoft Power BI.</p>\n\n<p>Power BI&rsquo;s ease of use enables everyone in your organization to benefit from our analytics stack. Employees can get their insights in seconds from all enterprise data stored in Azure. And without limitations on concurrency, Power BI can be used across teams to create the most beautiful visualizations that deliver powerful insights.</p>\n\n<p>Leveraging Microsoft&rsquo;s <strong>Common Data Model</strong>, Power BI users can easily access and analyze enterprise data using a common data schema without needing complex data transformation. Customers looking for <a href=\"https://aka.ms/Petabyte-scale-Analytics-with-Power-BI-and-Azure\" target=\"_blank\">petabyte-scale analytics can leverage Power BI Aggregations</a> with Azure SQL Data Warehouse for rapid query. Better yet, Power BI users can easily apply sophisticated AI models built with Azure. Powerful insights easily accessible to all.</p>\n\n<p>Customers like Heathrow Airport, one of the busiest airports in the world, are empowering their employees with powerful insights:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>&ldquo;With Power BI, we can very quickly connect to a wide range of data sources with very little effort and use this data to run Heathrow more smoothly than ever before. Every day, we experience a huge amount of variability in our business. With Azure, we&rsquo;re getting to the point where we can anticipate passenger flow and stay ahead of disruption that causes stress for passengers and employee.&rdquo; </em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p align=\"right\">&ndash; Stuart Birrell, Chief Information Officer, <a href=\"https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/heathrow-airport-travel-transportation-powerbi-azure\">Heathrow Airport</a></p>\n\n<h2>Future-proof</h2>\n\n<p>We continue to focus on making Azure the best place for your data and analytics.
