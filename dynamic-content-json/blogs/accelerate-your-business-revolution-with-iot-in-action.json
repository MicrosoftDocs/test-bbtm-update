Our preconfigured solutions can accelerate your development process, so you can get up and running quickly. You can connect existing devices and add new ones using our device SDKs for platforms including Linux, Windows, and real-time operating systems. Scaling is easy, whether you want to add a few devices or a million.</p>\n\n<p>Azure IoT Suite can easily integrate with your existing systems and applications like Salesforce, SAP, and Oracle. You can also enhance security by setting up individual identities and credentials for each of your connected devices. Plus, Azure comes complete with built-in artificial intelligence and built-in machine learning.</p>\n\n<p>Watch the following interview with Sam George, Director of Azure IoT at Microsoft, to learn how Azure IoT is accelerating the digital transformation for businesses.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><iframe allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" gesture=\"media\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LhMqkvp6XhA\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\n\n<h2>So, what&rsquo;s new with Azure IoT?</h2>\n\n<p>Microsoft continues to evolve its suite to offer you the world&rsquo;s best IoT technology. Here are three notable releases that are smoothing the road to IoT.</p>\n\n<h3>Microsoft IoT Central</h3>\n\n<p>This highly scalable SaaS solution was recently released for public preview. It delivers a low-code way for companies to build IoT production grade applications in hours without needing to manage backend infrastructure or hire specialized talent. Features include device authentication, secure connectivity, extensive device SDKs with multi-language support, and native support for IoT protocols.
