    "Summary": "Today I am happy to announce the availability of StockTrader 6, a new end-to-end reference application for Windows Azure and Windows Azure SQL Database.&nbsp; The sample application with full sourceâ€¦",
    "Content": "<p>Today I am happy to announce the availability of StockTrader 6, a new end-to-end reference application for <a href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=cmp_pst001_blg_post0215tri\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Azure</a> and <a href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/features/data-management/?WT.mc_id=cmp_pst001_blg_post0215sql\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Azure SQL Database</a>.&nbsp; The sample application with full source code and Visual Studio solutions can be downloaded and installed from MSDN <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/stocktrader\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>  <p>If you want to check the application out before downloading it yourself, you can:</p>  <p>a) Browse a live deployment of the sample application on Windows Azure via HTML5/MVC <a href=\"https://azurestocktrader6.cloudapp.net/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. <br>b) Install and run the working mobile applications:</p>  <ol>  <li>Install the iOS application from the Apple App Store.</li>  <li>Install the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=stocktraderandroidclient.stocktraderandroidclient\" target=\"_blank\">Android application from the Google Play Store</a>.</li>  <li>The Windows 8 and Windows Phone clients are included in the download.</li>  </ol>  <h3>Sharing Client Code across Device Types</h3>  <p>One of the cool things about the sample is that each mobile client has a native user-interface for each device type, but via <a href=\"https://xamarin.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Xamarin</a> mono roughly 60% of the client code (including REST service calls, data communication, security, etc.) is <b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">shared</span></b> across all device types and written entirely in C#.</p>  <h3>Sharing a Single Azure Cloud Service Backend across Device Types</h3>  <p>Also, all clients across all devices work against the single, common Windows Azure Cloud Service backend.&nbsp; The backend is a Windows Azure RESTful service that scales out across as many middle-tier compute instances as you want. The data tier has also been specifically designed to optionally take advantage of Windows Azure SQL Database Federation for data tier scale out.</p>  <h3>More Details</h3>  <p>The focus of the sample is thus two-fold:</p>  <ol>  <li><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Cloud-connected mobile applications</span></b>: Illustrate how to adapt existing applications and services to extend the reach to all major mobile platforms, including Apple iPhone/iPad, Android devices, Windows 8, and HTML5, with shared client code across device types.</li>  <li><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Achieving backend scale</span></b>: Illustrate the use of SQL Database Federation for data-tier scale-out, in conjunction with <a href=\"https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/features/cloud-services/?WT.mc_id=cmp_pst001_blg_post0215cld\" target=\"_blank\">Windows Azure Cloud Services</a>, including optional use of Windows Azure Service Bus for durable, asynchronous messaging.</li>  </ol>  <h3>View Technical Presentation and Documents Online</h3>  <p>I highly encourage developers to also check out the following materials that cover the application itself, and the core technologies used:</p>  <ol>  <li><a href=\"https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/Australia/2012/AZR225\" target=\"_blank\">StockTrader 6 online technical presentation</a>&nbsp;(1 hour)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>  <li><a href=\"https://azurestocktrader.blob.core.windows.net/docs/Trade6Overview.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">StockTrader 6 Technical Whitepaper</a></li>  <li><a href=\"https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/Australia/2012/AZR432\" target=\"_blank\">SQL Database Federations Deep-dive presentation</a> (1 hour)</li>  </ol>  <p>You can post questions and discuss the StockTrader 6 sample application via the discussion forum on MSDN, which is easily accessed on the <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/stocktrader\" target=\"_blank\">MSDN landing page</a>.</p>"
