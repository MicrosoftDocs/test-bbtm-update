In this uncertain business environment, we have seen resilient organizations adapt in three dimensions: by supporting remote application development; improving business agility with a focus on Developer Velocity; and by driving cost savings. At Microsoft Ignite, we&#39;ve shared new capabilities that enable developers and the teams they support to become more resilient with Microsoft Visual Studio, GitHub, Microsoft Azure, and Microsoft Power Apps.</p>\n\n<h2 aria-level=\"2\" paraeid=\"{8e88f9a9-b697-440c-8139-324a65f65a0e}{198}\" paraid=\"966070541\" role=\"heading\">Creating resilient development teams with remote development</h2>\n\n<p paraeid=\"{8e88f9a9-b697-440c-8139-324a65f65a0e}{206}\" paraid=\"673048853\">At Build, we shared innovation in our developer tools and services that allow development teams to code, collaborate, and ship software from anywhere. Since then, we have seen how our customers have used these tools to adapt. The <a href=\"https://aka.ms/AMPAS\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a> has moved their development process to the cloud using Visual Studio and Azure, and in doing so have made their developer team twice as productive as before. We&rsquo;ve also <a href=\"https://aka.ms/RemoteEngDevOpsSummit-ondemand\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">shared our own stories</a> about how development teams at Microsoft have met the challenge of shifting to remote work. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p paraeid=\"{8e88f9a9-b697-440c-8139-324a65f65a0e}{240}\" paraid=\"1038915125\">In order to help developers meet today&rsquo;s challenges, we&rsquo;ve focused on making Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code the most productive developer tools for distributed development teams. Both have strong integration with GitHub, where over 50 million developers code together. With GitHub Codespaces, developers can create cloud-powered development environments right from Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. The release of Visual Studio 2019 16.8 Preview 3.1 includes support for the GitHub Codespaces beta.
