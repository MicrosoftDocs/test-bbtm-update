    "Content": "<p>Did you know an attacker can be present on a network for more than 200 days before being detected? Imagine the damage that can be done to an organization during that time: Accessing sensitive data about your company, products, employees and clients. Altering the operating system on every computer in your network. Causing irreparable damage to your company &ndash; both in terms of dollars and damaged reputation &ndash; before you even know he&rsquo;s there.</p>\n\n<p>Hackers typically gain control of a network using a privileged account (e.g., domain admin) within 24-48 hours of initiating the attack. They move silently through the network, avoiding actions that would alert IT to their presence. If they are discovered, it&rsquo;s usually by chance or an external notification.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know how a security breach actually happens? How hackers get a foothold, and what they do once they&rsquo;re in? Most importantly: Are you as secure as you think you are? Join me for a free webinar to learn how a breach actually happens and the steps you can take to help prevent an attack, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Common ways hackers get into your network, including phishing scams and targeted search results</li>\n\t<li>How hackers set up and manage long-term attacks</li>\n\t<li>Things you can do today to help prevent an attack</li>\n\t<li>The key response phases, including incident response, tactical recovery and strategic recovery</li>\n\t<li>Tips for developing an effective communications plan that won&rsquo;t compromise your data&rsquo;s security</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I hope you will join me and my colleague Jim Moeller, from the Enterprise Cybersecurity Group, to learn more about this critical topic.
