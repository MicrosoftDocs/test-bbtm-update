    "Content": "<p>We are excited to announce that Azure customers can now easily maximize the potential of the intelligent cloud through newly released <a href=\"https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/consulting-services\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Marketplace Consulting Services</a> offerings. This announcement builds on the success of Consulting Services offers for Dynamics 365 and Power BI that are listed in AppSource and is part of our commitment to investing in the cloud marketplace to be the premier place to find, try, and buy trusted cloud solutions.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you are seeking someone to help learn new skills in Azure, to handle the unique parameters of migrating a sensitive workload, or to create high-impact visual storytelling to drive business decision making, Azure Marketplace makes accessing this expertise easier than ever. The partners in Azure Marketplace can help you get started with confidence, rightsize, and optimize your cloud so you can accelerate your pace of innovation. These partners will provide tailored services and augment your internal capabilities, enabling you to grow your business quickly and securely.</p>\n\n<p>The new offer provides assessments, briefings, implementations, proof-of-concepts, and workshops by Microsoft partners with a Silver or Gold cloud competency, such as <a href=\"https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/consulting-services?page=1&amp;search=Bright%20Wolf\" target=\"_blank\">Bright Wolf a</a>nd <a href=\"https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/consulting-services/wipro-ltd.cmp-wipro?page=1\" target=\"_blank\">Wipro</a>. Each of these offers clearly presents what outcomes you can expect, delivered by a partner with the experience to provide deep personalization.</p>\n\n<p>Partners share our excitement. Peter Bourne, the CEO of Bright Wolf, shared this insight with us: <em>&ldquo;Our customers seek customized, differentiated Azure IoT solutions to grow their business, not an off-the-shelf or one-size-fits-all product. The consulting services offering helps them find experienced Microsoft partners like Bright Wolf directly and quickly, simplifying the process for everyone involved.&rdquo;</em></p>\n\n<p>These <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-marketplace-is-reaching-new-audiences/\" target=\"_blank\">services launched on May 7th</a> for customers in the United States. We plan to make these offers available in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia in the next few months, with additional countries coming online soon after.</p>\n\n<p>Take advantage of these new consulting services by simply navigating to the <a href=\"https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/consulting-services\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Marketplace Consulting Services</a> page to browse the offers catalog.
