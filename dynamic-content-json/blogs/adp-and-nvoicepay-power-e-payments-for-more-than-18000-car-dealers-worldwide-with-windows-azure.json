According to NVoicePay, the use of Windows Azure enabled  its payment network to go from zero to nearly $50 million in payment traffic in  a single year.&nbsp; </p>  <p>Check out the full press release here to learn more. </p>  <p><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=;layout=box_count&amp;show_faces=false&amp;width=300&amp;action=like&amp;font=segoe+ui&amp;colorscheme=light&amp;height=50\" style=\"overflow: hidden; width: 300px; height: 50px;\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><br><a data-via=\"Windowsazure\" data-count=\"horizontal\" data-url=\"\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share\" class=\"twitter-share-button\">Tweet</a>  <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script>  </p>"
