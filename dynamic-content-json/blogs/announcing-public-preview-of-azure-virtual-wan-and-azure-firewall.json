    "Content": "<p>Networking trends such as SDWAN (Software-Defined Wide Area Network) can improve performance by using path selection polices at the branch offices to send Internet-bound traffic directly to the cloud eliminating the backhaul to select breakout points. This traffic can quickly reach Microsoft&rsquo;s global backbone network with intelligent routing to provide the best network experience. However, having all branches directly accessing the Internet introduces new challenges such as managing branch connectivity and uniformly enforcing network and security polices at scale. Further complicating network policy management across all the branch offices is the trend of more employees working remotely with ever stricter security, privacy, and compliance requirements polices that vary by country/region.</p>\n\n<p>Network security plays an important role in protecting users, data and applications. Cloud developers and IT teams struggle to stay ahead of security attacks. Cloud native network security solutions better fit the modern dev ops model of building and deploying applications while taking advantage of the economic and scale benefits of the cloud. Customers need turnkey solutions that are easy to deploy, use, and manage that offer high availability and automatically scale.</p>\n\n<p>To help customers with these massive modernization efforts, we are announcing <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-wan\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Virtual WAN</a> to simplify large-scale branch connectivity, and <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-firewall\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Firewall</a> to enforce your network security polices while taking advantage of the scale and simplicity provided by the cloud.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Azure Virtual WAN</h2>\n\n<p>The new Azure Virtual WAN service provides optimized, automated and global scale branch connectivity. Virtual WAN brings the ability to seamlessly connect your branches to Azure with SDWAN &amp; VPN devices (i.e. Customer Premises Equipment or CPE) with built in ease of use and automated connectivity and configuration management.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/a58e3b2c-1c50-43e4-a344-c6c7c492e65a.png\"><img alt=\"Figure 1\" border=\"0\" height=\"336\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/3bce192f-a95d-41d1-b302-2310d654c459.png\" style=\"background-image: none; float: none; margin-left: auto; display: block; margin-right: auto; border-image: none\" title=\"Figure 1\" width=\"980\"></a></p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Connect SDWAN and VPN devices to Hubs that comprise an Azure Virtual WAN</p>\n\n<p>Virtual WAN provides a better networking experience by taking advantage of Microsoft&rsquo;s global network. Traffic from your branches enters Microsoft&rsquo;s network at the Microsoft edge site closest to a given branch office. We have over 130 edge sites or Points of Presence (PoPs). Once your traffic is in the Microsoft global network, it terminates in a virtual hub. An Azure Virtual WAN is composed of multiple virtual hubs. You can create your hubs in different Azure regions. Azure has more global regions than any other public cloud provider bringing your virtual hubs close to your branches around the world.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a simple example with a virtual hub in West Europe (Netherlands) and another in North Europe (Ireland). These two hubs are part of a customer&rsquo;s Azure Virtual WAN. Branch offices connect to the closest virtual hub for the very best performance.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/bb127116-46b2-4bad-bb6c-57c886666f66.png\"><img alt=\"Azure Virtual WAN\" border=\"0\" height=\"739\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/00935ff5-c8aa-48b7-abba-f52568dd39f9.png\" style=\"background-image: none; float: none; margin-left: auto; display: block; margin-right: auto; border-image: none\" title=\"Azure Virtual WAN\" width=\"1430\"></a></p>\n\n<p>We are launching Azure Virtual WAN Preview with <a href=\"https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2018/07/12/citrix-sd-wan-with-microsoft-azure-virtual-wan-improves-workspace-experience-and-productivity-in-branch-and-remote-locations/\" target=\"_blank\">Citrix</a> and <a href=\"https://aka.ms/riverbed-vwan-blog\" target=\"_blank\">Riverbed</a> providing a fully automated branch connectivity experience.
