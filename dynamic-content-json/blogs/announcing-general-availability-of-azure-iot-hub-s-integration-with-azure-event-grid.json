    "Content": "<p>We&rsquo;re proud to see more and more customers using <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-what-is-iot-hub\" target=\"_blank\">Azure IoT Hub</a> to control and manage billions of devices, send data to the cloud and gain business insights. We are excited to announce that IoT Hub integration with <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-grid/overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Event Grid</a> is now<strong> generally available</strong>, making it even easier to transform these insights into actions by simplifying the architecture of IoT solutions. Some key benefits include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>Easily integrate with modern serverless architectures, such as <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Functions</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-what-are-logic-apps\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Logic Apps</a>, to automate workflows and downstream processes.</li>\n <li>Enable alerting with quick reaction to creation, deletion, connection, and disconnection of devices.</li>\n <li>Eliminate the complexity and expense of polling services and integrate events with 3rd party applications using webhooks such as ticketing, billing system, and database updates.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Together, these two services help customers easily integrate event notifications from IoT solutions with other powerful Azure services or 3rd party applications. These services add important device lifecycle support with events such as device created, device deleted, device connected, and device disconnected, in a highly reliable, scalable, and secure manner.</p>\n\n<p>Here is how it works:</p>\n\n<p><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Internet-of-Things-Show/Azure-IoT-Hub-and-Event-Grid/player\" width=\"960\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p><br>\nAs of today, this capability is available in the following regions:</p>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\">\n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\">\n   <ul><!--StartFragment-->\n    <li>Asia Southeast</li>\n    <li>Asia East</li>\n    <li>Australia East</li>\n    <li>Australia Southeast</li>\n    <li>Central US</li>\n    <li>East US</li>\n    <li>East US 2</li>\n    <li>West Central US</li>\n    <!--EndFragment-->\n   </ul>\n   </td>\n   <td valign=\"top\">\n   <ul><!--StartFragment-->\n    <li>West US</li>\n    <li>West US 2</li>\n    <li>South Central US</li>\n    <li>Europe West</li>\n    <li>Europe North</li>\n    <li>Japan East</li>\n    <li>Japan West</li>\n    <li>Korea Central</li>\n    <!--EndFragment-->\n   </ul>\n   </td>\n   <td valign=\"top\">\n   <ul><!--StartFragment-->\n    <li>Korea South</li>\n    <li>Canada Central</li>\n    <li>Canada East</li>\n    <li>Central India</li>\n    <li>South India</li>\n    <li>Brazil South</li>\n    <li>UK West</li>\n    <li>UK South</li>\n    <!--EndFragment-->\n   </ul>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<ul>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-the-general-availability-of-azure-event-grid/\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Event Grid became generally available</a> earlier this year and currently has built-in integration with the following services:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/c748007d-2176-47c5-95f3-882f56b03ceb.png\"><img alt=\"Azure Event Grid service integration\" border=\"0\" height=\"425\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/a0bec074-b924-4e48-8ead-25a93d46576a.png\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;\" title=\"Azure Event Grid service integration\" width=\"640\"></a></p>\n\n<p>As we work to deliver more events from Azure IoT Hub, we are excited for you to try this capability and build more streamlined IoT solutions for your business. Try this <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/publish-iot-hub-events-to-logic-apps\" target=\"_blank\">tutorial</a> to get started.</p>\n\n<p>We would love to hear more about your experiences with the preview and get your feedback! Are there other IoT Hub events you would like to see made available?
