    "Content": "<p>In 2019, Microsoft and Pivotal (now VMware) announced <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/spring-cloud/\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Spring Cloud</a>, a fully managed service for Spring Boot applications. We set out to solve many of the common challenges enterprise developers face when running Spring Boot applications at scale. The service manages dynamic scaling, security patching,&nbsp;out-of-the-box instrumentation for monitoring,&nbsp;and more&nbsp;so developers can focus on their apps. Since then, we&rsquo;ve worked with many customers including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfgiW6xJseM\" target=\"_blank\">Kroger</a>, <a href=\"https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1358540087031302788-swiss-re-accelerates-java-app-modernization-using-azure-spring-cloud\" target=\"_blank\">Swiss Re</a>, <a href=\"https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1388620728739667057-raleys-uses-azure-spring-cloud-to-optimize-scale-and-drive-innovation\" target=\"_blank\">Raley&rsquo;s</a>, and <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/java/deploy-spring-boot-applications-by-leveraging-enterprise-best-practices/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Realty</a> to help them adopt the service.</p>\n\n<p>We also learned that some customers need more. Many are running thousands of Spring Boot applications on-premises and need advanced capabilities to accelerate their Spring modernization projects. Based on our learnings, we started worked on a new Azure Spring Cloud tier with commercially supported components to meet the needs of enterprise customers. Now, we are announcing the availability of&nbsp;Azure Spring Cloud Enterprise&nbsp;in preview.</p>\n\n<p>Azure Spring Cloud Enterprise is a managed service for Spring that is optimized for the needs of enterprise developers.
