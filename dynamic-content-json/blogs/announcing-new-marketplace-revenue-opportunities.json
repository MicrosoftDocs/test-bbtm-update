    "Content": "<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s success has always been based on working closely with our vibrant partner community to meet our collective customers&rsquo; needs. With the rapid growth of cloud, we have invested to ensure our partners realize this growth as well.</p>\n\n<p>Today, we&#39;re excited to announce expanded opportunities for Microsoft partners through new marketplace investments and expanding the very successful IP Co-sell Program.</p>\n\n<h2>New Marketplace capabilities</h2>\n\n<p>Customers are pursuing cloud technology to find the right solution for their needs quickly and efficiently. To make this easier, we are expanding our marketplace investments in both <a href=\"https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-US/\" target=\"_blank\">AppSource</a> and <a href=\"https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Marketplace</a> so customers can find a broader set of solutions from Microsoft and our partner ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>Our cloud marketplaces will now support <strong>transaction capabilities for SaaS solutions from partners </strong>making it a one-stop experience for customers looking for a cloud-based solution. AppSource and Azure Marketplace will offer both per-seat and per-site SaaS transaction capability for our partners who build on, extend, or connect to Microsoft Azure, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and the Microsoft Power Platform. The ISVs who offer transactable SaaS solutions in our marketplace and participate in the co-sell program will earn a reduced transaction fee of 10 percent. We will continue to invest in new marketplace capabilities to help customers find the solutions they need and enable greater partner growth.</p>\n\n<h2>Expanding our IP co-sell program</h2>\n\n<p>Two years ago, we introduced our IP Co-sell Program that brought the Microsoft salesforce, the largest enterprise salesforce in the world, to sell our partners&rsquo; solutions built on Microsoft Azure. This collaboration between ISV partners and Azure sellers generated over $5B in partner revenue in the past year from nearly 3,000 ISVs, engaging with more than 30,000 enterprise customer opportunities. Based on this incredible success, we are expanding the IP Co-sell Program beyond Azure to now also include partners building on Microsoft 365, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and the Microsoft Power Platform.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>A new channel for ISVs</h2>\n\n<p>We are also expanding the IP Co-sell Program to Microsoft&rsquo;s global resellers which creates a new channel for ISVs to grow their business. Starting on July 1, 2019, all Microsoft ISVs with published offers in AppSource or Azure Marketplace will have access to a new distribution method through Microsoft&rsquo;s worldwide reseller channel. This opens new growth opportunities for both ISVs and reseller partners while bringing a broader range of solutions to customers.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Learn more about how to publish your solutions on <a href=\"https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/partners\" target=\"_blank\">AppSource</a> and <a href=\"https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/sell\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Marketplace</a> and how to take advantage of the new <a href=\"https://partner.microsoft.com/en-US/reach-customers/gtm\" target=\"_blank\">go-to-market services</a> and <a href=\"https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/asset/collection/azure-marketplace-and-appsource#/\" target=\"_blank\">onboarding</a> resources.</p>\n"
