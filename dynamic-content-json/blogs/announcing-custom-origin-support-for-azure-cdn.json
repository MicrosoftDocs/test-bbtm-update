    "Title": "Announcing Custom Origin Support for Azure CDN",
    "Summary": "We've recently made a number of significant updates for Azure CDN that are available from the Azure Portal. In this post, we'll give you a quick summary.",
    "Content": "<h2>Custom Origins Supported</h2>\nAzure CDN can now be used with any origin. Previously, Azure CDN only supported a limited set of Azure Services (i.e. Web Apps, Storage, Cloud Services and Media Services) and you only had the ability to create a CDN endpoint for an Azure Service that was in your Azure Subscription. With this recent update, you can now create a CDN endpoint for any origin you like. This includes the ability to create an origin in your own data center, an origin provided by third party cloud providers, etc. and gives you the flexibility to use any origin you like with Azure CDN!\n<h2>Multiple CDN Endpoints with the Same Origin</h2>\nSeveral of you may have tried to create multiple CDN endpoints for the same origin and found this wasn’t possible due to restrictions. We have now removed the restrictions and you now have the ability to create multiple endpoints for the same origin URL. This provides you a more refined control over content management and can be used to improve performance as multiple host names can be used to access assets from the same origin.\n<h2>Save Content in any Origin Folder</h2>\nPreviously, when you created a CDN endpoint for cloud services you were required to use “/cdn/” as the default origin path. For example, if the path for your cloud service was <a href=\"/\"><span style=\"color: #0563c1; font-family: Calibri;\"></span></a> you were required to use <a href=\"/cdn/\"><span style=\"color: #0563c1; font-family: Calibri;\">/cdn/</span></a> as the root path to get content from your origin when you created a CDN endpoint. This restriction has been removed and you can store content in any folder. Using the previous example, you can now use <a href=\"/\"><span style=\"color: #0563c1; font-family: Calibri;\">/</span></a>as the root path to get content from your origin.\n\n<a href=\"https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/blogmedia/blogmedia/2015/06/03/annoucing-custom-origin-blog-picture.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-303591\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/annoucing-custom-origin-blog-picture-636x288.png\" alt=\"annoucing custom origin blog picture\" width=\"636\" height=\"288\" /></a>\n\nYou may have also noticed a greyed out “Manage CDN” icon in the Azure Portal. This will be enabled for everyone shortly and once it is, we will have another blog post on the new capabilities it will provide. Stay tuned!\n\nFor more details about steps to create a CDN endpoint, please see: <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/cdn-create-new-endpoint/\" target=\"_blank\">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/cdn-create-new-endpoint/</a>."
