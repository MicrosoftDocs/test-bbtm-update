Our ability to meet your business and innovation needs is in part due to our growth mindset&mdash;which extends from front-end user experiences to small details like graphics and icons.</p>\n\n<p>One detail updating today is the Azure &ldquo;A&rdquo; icon, which will be rolled out in product experiences and across related sites in the coming weeks. The new Azure icon represents the unity of Azure within the larger Microsoft family of product icons. It&rsquo;s part of Microsoft&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/#/\" target=\"_blank\">Fluent Design System</a>, carefully crafted to produce icons that look familiar to what customers know and love, while representing the agile future of our business.&nbsp;The icon is used most commonly to denote the Azure product in architectures and across product experiences. Azure&rsquo;s primary logo continues to be the Microsoft four square.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/6a669a37-0ef5-41b3-8ea7-449552243735.png\"><img alt=\"The new Azure product family icon.
