SQL Server 2017 also provides new capabilities, including graph data management and analysis, Adaptive Query Processing, and advanced intelligence built-in with Python and R analytics plus native scoring in t-SQL.

You will find images for all editions available on Windows Server 2016 as well as on all Linux distributions supported by SQL Server 2017: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4, SUSE Enterprise Linux 12 SP3, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Editions include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>SQL Developer &ndash; Free full edition of SQL Server for development and testing (not for production)</li>\n <li>SQL Express &ndash; Entry level free database for lightweight workloads (1 GB memory, 10 GB storage)</li>\n <li>SQL Web &ndash; Low-cost database for small to medium-size web applications</li>\n <li>SQL Standard &ndash; Core database capabilities for medium-size workloads</li>\n <li>SQL Enterprise &ndash; Full edition of SQL Server with comprehensive capabilities for mission-critical or large transactional processing, data warehousing, and business intelligence workloads</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Why run SQL Server on an Azure Virtual Machine</h2>\n\n<p>Advantages of running SQL Server in Azure include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>Cloud flexibility &ndash; Setup and manage your SQL Server deployments in minutes, and then scale up or down on the fly</li>\n <li>Tuned for performance &ndash; Meet your toughest demands with virtual machines optimized by the team that built SQL Server</li>\n <li>Hybrid connectivity &ndash; Get the most out of your on-premises investments, and take advantage of all that Azure offers</li>\n <li>Highly-secured and trusted &ndash; Protect your entire data estate with a highly-secured database on the most compliant cloud</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/ff449b72-252c-4f2d-bdfc-af252cc0ccb9.png\"><img alt=\"Why run Azure\" border=\"0\" height=\"326\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/3492bae8-aafa-4d1e-b3e5-0cfdb81833da.png\" style=\"border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;\" title=\"Why run Azure\" width=\"1024\"></a></p>\n\n<h2>Recent Azure enhancements</h2>\n\n<p>Latest versions of the most popular VM sizes (DS, ES, GS, and MS) include options which constrain the vCPU count to one-half or one-quarter of the original VM size, while maintaining the same memory, storage, and I/O bandwidth. The licensing charged for SQL Server will be constrained to the new vCPU count, resulting in a 50% to 75% increase in the ratio of the VM specs to active (billable) vCPUs while allowing workloads to maximize usage of available vCPU.</p>\n\n<p>Also, Azure customers can now build out increased resiliency by using availability zones. Availability zones are a step forward in providing customers with solutions to support the most demanding, mission-critical workloads. Please visit the <a href=\"https://aka.ms/azoverview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Availability Zones documentation page</a> for more information.</p>\n\n<h2>Customer example</h2>\n\n<p>Customers are already running SQL Server 2017 in production on Azure Virtual Machines, including now running SQL Server on Linux-based VMs. <a href=\"https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/dv01\" target=\"_blank\">dv01</a>, a financial reporting and analytics platform, previously ran open source software on competitor cloud. However, as the company grew and complexity increased, dv01&rsquo;s applications began to slow. By moving to SQL Server running on Azure virtual machines, they were able to reduce query response time from 30 seconds to 1-2 seconds and cut management time by 90 percent. Additionally, Linux support offered in SQL Server 2017 has allowed dv01 avoid having to manage an environment with two operating systems.</p>\n\n<h2>Get started today</h2>\n\n<p>Easily get started today in minutes with a <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/sql/provision-sql-server-linux-virtual-machine\" target=\"_blank\">Linux-based SQL Server VM</a>&nbsp; or <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sql/virtual-machines-windows-portal-sql-server-provision\" target=\"_blank\">Windows-based SQL Server VM</a>.
