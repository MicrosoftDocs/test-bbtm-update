    "Content": "<p>We&rsquo;re pleased to announce the following services which are now available in the UK!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Azure Container Service</strong> &ndash;&nbsp; Azure Container Service is the fastest way to realize the benefits of running containers in production. It uses customers&rsquo; preferred choice of open source technology, tools, and skills, combined with the confidence of solid support and a thriving community ecosystem. Simplified configurations of proven open source container orchestration technology, optimized to run in the Azure cloud, are provided. In just a few clicks, customers can deploy in production container-based applications, and on a framework designed to help manage the complexity of containers deployed at scale. Unlike other container services, Azure Container Service is built on 100% open source software and offer a choice between open source orchestrators Kubernetes, DC/OS, or Docker Swarm with Swarm mode.<br>\n<strong>The UK region is the first Azure region featuring Docker Swarm mode instead of legacy Swarm.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-service/\">Container Service</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/d807859e-dd2f-4792-8625-8c6b3437dc65.jpg\"><img alt=\"20170628 UK Blog\" border=\"0\" height=\"483\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/351d7993-bb53-4f0b-acff-2c1b14a49a49.jpg\" style=\"border: 0px currentColor; border-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; float: none; display: block; background-image: none;\" title=\"20170628 UK Blog\" width=\"725\"></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Log Analytics &ndash; </strong>Azure Log Analytics is a service in the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/operations-management-suite/\">Operations Management Suite (OMS)</a> offering that monitors your cloud and on-premises environments to maintain their availability and performance. It collects data generated by resources in your hybrid cloud environments and from other monitoring tools to provide insights and analysis and help you detect and respond to issues quickly.<br>\nWith the availability of Log Analytics in the UK, you can now access a full set of operations management and security services (Log Analytics, Automation, Security Center, Backup and Site Recovery) in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/\">Log Analytics</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Logic Apps</strong> &ndash;&nbsp; Logic Apps provide a way to simplify and implement scalable integrations and workflows in the cloud. It provides a visual designer to model and automate your process as a series of steps known as a workflow. Logic Apps is a fully managed iPaaS (integration Platform as a Service) allowing developers not to have to worry about building, hosting, scalability, availability and management. Logic Apps scale up automatically to meet demand.</p>\n\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/logic-apps/\">Logic Apps</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Azure Stream Analytics</strong> &ndash;&nbsp; Azure Stream Analytics is a fully managed, cost effective real-time event processing engine that helps to unlock deep insights from data. Stream Analytics makes it easy to set up real-time analytic computations on data streaming from devices, sensors, web sites, social media, applications, infrastructure systems, and more.</p>\n\n<p>With a few clicks in the Azure portal, you can author a Stream Analytics job specifying the input source of the streaming data, the output sink for the results of your job, and a data transformation expressed in a SQL-like language. You can monitor and adjust the scale/speed of your job in the Azure portal to scale from a few kilobytes to a gigabyte or more of events processed per second.<br>\nStream Analytics leverages years of Microsoft Research work in developing highly tuned streaming engines for time-sensitive processing, as well as language integrations for intuitive specifications of such.</p>\n\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/stream-analytics/\">Stream Analytics</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SQL Threat Detection</strong> &ndash;&nbsp; SQL Threat Detection provides a new layer of security, which enables customers to detect and respond to potential threats as they occur by providing security alerts on anomalous activities. Users will receive an alert upon suspicious database activities, potential vulnerabilities, and SQL injection attacks, as well as anomalous database access patterns. SQL Threat Detection alerts provide details of suspicious activity and recommend action on how to investigate and mitigate the threat. Users can explore the suspicious events using <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-auditing\">SQL Database Auditing</a> to determine if they are caused by an attempt to access, breach, or exploit data in the database. Threat Detection makes it simple to address potential threats to the database without the need to be a security expert or manage advanced security monitoring systems.</p>\n\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-threat-detection\">SQL Threat Detection</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SQL Data Sync Public Preview</strong> &ndash;&nbsp; SQL Data Sync (Preview) is a service of SQL Database that enables you to synchronize the data you select across multiple SQL Server and SQL Database instances. To synchronize your data, you create sync groups which define the databases, tables and columns to synchronize as well as the synchronization schedule. Each sync group must have at least one SQL Database instance which serves as the sync group hub in a hub-and-spoke topology.</p>\n\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-sql-data-sync-refresh/\">Azure SQL Data Sync</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Managed Disks SSE (Storage Service Encryption)</strong> &ndash;&nbsp; <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-service-encryption\">Azure Storage Service Encryption</a> (SSE) is now supported for Managed Disks. SSE provides encryption-at-rest and safeguards your data to meet your organizational security and compliance commitments.<br>\nStarting June 10th, 2017, all new managed disks, snapshots, images and new data written to existing managed disks are automatically encrypted-at-rest with keys managed by Microsoft.</p>\n\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-managed-disks-sse/\">Storage Service Encryption for Azure Managed Disks</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We are excited about these additions, and invite customers using the UK Azure region to try them today!</p>\n"
