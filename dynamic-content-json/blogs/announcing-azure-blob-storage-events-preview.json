    "Summary": "Azure Blob storage events allow applications to react to the creation and deletion of blobs through Azure Event Grid subscriptions.",
    "Content": "<p>In conjunction with the recently <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-azure-event-grid-an-event-service-for-modern-applications/\">announced</a> <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-grid/\">Azure Event Grid</a> preview, we are pleased to announce the preview of <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-event-overview\"><strong>Azure Blob storage events</strong></a>.</p>\n\n<p>Azure Blob storage is a massively-scalable object storage platform. With exabytes of capacity and massive scalability, Azure Blob storage easily and cost-effectively stores hundreds to billions of objects, in hot or cool tiers, and supports any type of data&mdash;images, videos, audio, documents, and more.</p>\n\n<p>Blob storage events allow applications to react to the creation and deletion of blobs without the need for complicated code and expensive, inefficient polling services. Instead, events are pushed directly to event handlers such as <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/\">Azure Functions</a>, <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/logic-apps/\">Azure Logic Apps</a>, or your own custom http listener.</p>\n\n<p>Blob storage events are made possible by Azure Event Grid, which enables event based programming in Azure by providing reliable distribution of events for all services in Azure and third-party services. With publisher/subscriber semantics, event sources like Azure Blob Storage push events to Event Grid, which routes, filters, and reliably distributes them to subscribers with WebHooks, queues, and Event Hubs as endpoints. Event Grid is baked into the Azure ecosystem so it is as easy as point and click to connect your storage account to your event handler. Azure Event Grid has a pay-per-event pricing model, so you only pay for what you use. Additionally, to help you get started quickly, the first 100,000 operations per month are free. Beyond 100,000 per month, pricing is $0.30 per million operations (per-operation) during the preview. More details can be found on the <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/event-grid/\">pricing page</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The preview of Blob storage events is available now for Blob storage accounts in the US West Central location with additional locations coming soon. To learn more, and to sign up for the preview, see <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-event-overview\">Azure Blob storage events</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We would love to hear more about your experiences with the preview and get your feedback! Are there other storage events you would like to see made available? Drop us a line at <a href=\"mailto:azurestorageevents@microsoft.com\">azurestorageevents@microsoft.com</a> and let us know.</p>\n\n<p>Happy eventing!</p>\n"
