    "Summary": "As you might heard, we are announcing Public Preview of Visual Studio Application Insights, which is an analytics solution for any app that brings together Application Performance Management and Usage Analytics.",
    "Content": "I am very excited with all the announcements being made at <a href=\"https://www.buildwindows.com/\">Microsoft BUILD</a> conference today! As you might have read in <a href=\"https://aka.ms/soma-build-2015\">Soma’s blog</a> and <a href=\"https://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2015/04/29/visual-studio-and-team-foundation-server-at-build-2015.aspx\">Brian Harry’s blog</a>, we are announcing <em>Public Preview</em> of <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/application-insights/\">Visual Studio Application Insights</a>, which is an analytics solution for any app that brings together <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-insights-detect-triage-diagnose\">Application Performance Management</a> and <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-insights-overview-usage\">Usage Analytics</a>.\n\nApplication Insights provides development teams with a comprehensive 360° view across their live application’s performance, availability and usage. With intuitive views and powerful tools for fast troubleshooting and diagnostics, it helps you analyze user activity and adoption, so that you can prioritize future work accordingly.\n\nAs part of Application Insights' Public Preview we are launching a new <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/application-insights/\">cloud-friendly pricing model</a> that is based on telemetry volume per app and designed to offer great value for free for all development teams. Pricing goes into effect June 2015, and will be at 50% discount while in Public Preview.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-288621 size-large\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/360-Overview-636x329.png\" alt=\"360 Overview\" width=\"636\" height=\"329\" />\n<h2>Can I really use it for any app?</h2>\nYes. There’s a wide and growing range of platforms we support.\n\nOur <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-ios/\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-android/\">Android</a> SDKs provide support for usage insights and crash diagnostics, thanks to the powerful capabilities we are integrating from <a href=\"https://blogs.msdn.com/b/somasegar/archive/2014/12/11/microsoft-acquires-hockeyapp-leading-mobile-crash-analytics-and-beta-distribution-service-for-ios-android-and-windows-phone.aspx\">HockeyApp</a>. And of course we support <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-windows-get-started\">Windows</a> Phone, Store and UAP apps.\n\n<a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-java-get-started\">J2EE</a> apps are supported with out-of-the-box telemetry on any development platform, and with integrated tools if you’re using Eclipse.\n\n<a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-start-monitoring-app-health-usage/\">ASP.NET</a> developers can opt-in to Application Insights with one click in Visual Studio. And if yours is an <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/insights-perf-analytics\">Azure Web App or running in an Azure VM</a>, you’ll find Application Insights tightly coupled there too.\n\nUsing our <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-javascript/\">JavaScript SDK</a>, you can send telemetry from any web page.\n\nAdditionally there are Application Insights SDKs for a growing <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-platforms\">range of languages and platforms</a> such as PHP, Python, Ruby, Node.js, WordPress, and SharePoint.\n\nIf you'd like to, you can write your own. For each app type, an Application Insights SDK sends telemetry to our service, to be analyzed and presented to you in the portal. So any app can be monitored, if there’s an SDK for its platform. And although Application Insights is a service hosted in Azure, you really can use it on any app, regardless of the platform or where it is hosted.\n<h2>Who's using it?</h2>\nWe already have close to 450,000 applications using Application Insights. Every day, more and more developers are adding Application Insights to their apps.\n\nHere is what a few of our customers are saying:\n<blockquote>“I have a vision of a complete DevOps story, and AI could help us get there. AI has already helped us solve problems we wouldn’t have even identified without it!”\n- Joona Kokkola, Director, Technology, Maestro (Finland)\n\n“Application Insights is not just an operations tool for determining performance or user behavior. It’s truly part of the development process!”\n- Ray Escamilla, QA and Release Manager, Dominion Enterprises (US)\n\n“Application Insights has become a cornerstone service for monitoring over $50 Billion of Microsoft’s revenue in our org and we are excited for its future!”\n- Eric Mattingly, Service Engineer, Microsoft Enterprise Commerce</blockquote>\nThey are happy because Application Insights gives them:\n<ul>\n <li>360° Views across availability, performance and usage</li>\n <li>Fast and powerful troubleshooting, diagnostics and usage insights</li>\n <li>Built-in analytics for any app</li>\n <li>Great value for free with a cloud friendly pricing model</li>\n</ul>\nLet’s look at each of those in turn.\n<h2>360° Views across Availability, Performance and Usage</h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2669915\">According to Gartner</a>, the need for a complete view across availability, performance and usage is ranked as one of the Top 10 mobile technologies and capabilities organizations must master in 2015-2016. With Application Insights you can achieve an integrated view from every angle across your entire application stack and even across multiple platforms in one place.\n\nYou can trace user paths through your scenarios with <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-custom-events-metrics-api/\">custom instrumentation</a> and can take advantage of powerful drill down capabilities, slicing and dicing your data, <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-metrics-explorer/\">filtering and segmenting</a> it and <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-diagnostic-search/\">searching specific instances</a>, allowing you to answer questions such as:\n<ul>\n <li>Do I have performance bottlenecks?</li>\n <li>Am I attracting new users faster or slower than last month?</li>\n <li>How were my users impacted by service performance issues?</li>\n <li>Which user segments were impacted the most?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fast and Powerful Troubleshooting and Diagnostics</h2>\nYou can't afford downtime in your application or service. As a developer or service engineer, you have to identify issues before they impact your business. The tools in Application Insights let you identify and diagnose issues as soon as they occur.\n\nReal-time mobile crash analytics allows you to get crash details from the device, understand what happened leading up to the crash, and prioritize fixes based on customer impact. For your web applications, you can diagnose failed requests, exceptions &amp; dependency failures, and even correlate with your <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-search-diagnostic-logs/\">trace logs</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-custom-events-metrics-api/\">custom events</a> for deeper context.\n\n<a href=\"https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/blogmedia/blogmedia/2015/04/29/AI-Mobile-Crash-Diagnostics1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-288791 size-large\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/AI-Mobile-Crash-Diagnostics1-636x307.png\" alt=\"AI Mobile Crash Diagnostics\" width=\"636\" height=\"307\" /></a>\n\nFor web apps, you can <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-set-alerts/\">set up alerts</a> based on <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-monitor-web-app-availability/\">web tests or URL pings</a> and define your own metrics-based thresholds so that you know about abnormal service behaviors before they impact customers.\n\n<a href=\"https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/blogmedia/blogmedia/2015/04/29/Alerts1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-289251 size-large\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/Alerts1-636x296.png\" alt=\"Alerts\" width=\"636\" height=\"296\" /></a>\n<h2>Built-in Analytics for Any App</h2>\nWe have designed Application Insights to be an integral part of your development process and have made it <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/application-insights/\">easy</a> to add to both new and existing applications, even if they are <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-monitor-performance-live-website-now/\">already live in production</a>. It collects vital application data automatically with practically no effort, and is already part of your development workflow if you are using Visual Studio.\n\n<a href=\"https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/blogmedia/blogmedia/2015/04/29/AI-NewProject2.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-288821 size-large\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/AI-NewProject2-636x282.png\" alt=\"AI-NewProject\" width=\"636\" height=\"282\" /></a>\n\nWe take the same approach across many IDEs. Here’s the equivalent tool in Xcode:\n\n<a href=\"https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/blogmedia/blogmedia/2015/04/29/Xcode-Integration.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-289281 size-large\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/Xcode-Integration-636x345.png\" alt=\"Xcode Integration\" width=\"636\" height=\"345\" /></a>\n\nAs you’ve seen, the Application Insights portal provides a range of powerful analytic and search tools that you can apply to the stream of telemetry data from your apps. In addition, you can <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-insights-export-telemetry/\">export data</a> to external systems to let you mashup your telemetry with other data sources and perform further analysis.\n<h2>Great value for Free with Cloud Friendly Pricing Model</h2>\nOur new cloud friendly <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/application-insights/\">pricing model</a> (from June 2015) is based on data volume per application. In the Free tier, you get most of the features with some limitations on volume of data and how long it is retained. As your application grows and you need more history, you can take advantage of the Standard and Premium tiers. You pay for volume of data. It doesn’t matter how many servers are deployed. We want to let you scale dynamically, without penalty for resources you haven’t used. And while we’re in Public Preview, there’s a 50% discount.\n\n<a href=\"https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/blogmedia/blogmedia/2015/04/29/Pricing1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-289361 size-large\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/Pricing1-596x369.png\" alt=\"Pricing\" width=\"596\" height=\"369\" /></a>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\nIf you haven’t already, do try out <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/services/application-insights/\">Application Insights</a> today!
