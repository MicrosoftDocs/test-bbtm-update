Additionally, we are also announcing the general availability of Windows Azure Hyper-V Recovery Manager so our customers can enjoy the benefits of improved application availability.</p>\n<p><strong>Windows Azure Validated for PCI DSS Compliance</strong> Payment fraud continues to be a huge concern for the growing number of organizations that accept credit card payments. We are pleased to announce that Windows Azure has been validated for compliance with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards (DSS) by an independent Qualified Security Assessor (QSA).</p>\n<p>The PCI DSS is the global standard that any organization of any size must adhere to in order to accept payment cards, and to store, process, and/or transmit cardholder data. By providing PCI DSS validated infrastructure and platform services, Windows Azure delivers a compliant framework for you to run your own secure and compliant applications. You can more easily achieve PCI DSS certification for those applications using Windows Azure.</p>\n<p>To assist customers in achieving PCI DSS certification, Microsoft is making the Windows Azure PCI Attestation of Compliance and Windows Azure Customer PCI Guide available for immediate download.</p>\n<p>Visit the <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/trust-center/\" target=\"_blank\">Trust Center</a> for a full list of in scope features or for more information on Windows Azure security and compliance.</p>\n<p><strong>ISO Certification </strong>expanded to Include SQL Database and Many More Windows Azure Features<strong></strong></p>\n<p>Windows Azure has successfully completed its annual ISO audit.
