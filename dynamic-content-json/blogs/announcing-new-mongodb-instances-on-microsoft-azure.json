    "Content": "Since the previous release of production-ready MongoLab plans on Microsoft Azure, we’ve seen demand increase significantly. The MongoLab and Microsoft teams have been working together to develop a solution for your growing requirements and are excited to announce the arrival of our newest high-memory MongoDB database plans, with virtual machine choices that now provide up to 56GB of RAM per node with availability in all eight Microsoft Azure datacenters worldwide.\n\nScott Guthrie, Cloud &amp; Enterprise Executive Vice President at Microsoft says, “We have been working with MongoLab for a long time to bring a fully-managed Database-as-a-Service offering for MongoDB to Microsoft Azure. With full production support for all VM types across all datacenters, we are excited and optimistic for the future of MongoDB on our cloud platform and think there is no better place to run your application in the cloud than Microsoft Azure.”\n<h3><strong>Highlights of MongoLab's Dedicated Cluster plans on Microsoft Azure:</strong></h3>\n&nbsp;\n<h4><strong>Highly-Available MongoDB Cloud Hosting</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n <li>Dedicated virtual machines (up to 56GB of RAM)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n <li>Multi-zone automatic failover using MongoDB Replica Sets</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>MongoDB Management Tools</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n <li>Free daily system-level backup or custom backups with easy restore</li>\n <li>Real-time and historical monitoring of key performance metrics</li>\n <li>Automated query analysis and index recommendations</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>MongoDB Support</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n <li>Expert, timely email support as well as a 24x7 emergency support hotline</li>\n <li>Availability SLA</li>\n <li>Commercial Support from MongoDB, Inc. with one-hour SLA</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Getting Started:</strong></h3>\n&nbsp;\n<h4><strong>Try it out on MongoLab.com</strong><strong></strong></h4>\nHead over to our Microsoft Azure page, click “Get Started Now” and select which plan and datacenter you’d like to provision your new MongoDB.
