    "Content": "<p>Last November, we announced a community technology preview (CTP) of the <a href=\"https://blogs.msdn.com/windowsazure/archive/2009/11/05/introducing-the-windows-azure-content-delivery-network.aspx\">Windows Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN).</a> The <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/\">Windows Azure</a> CDN enhances end user performance and reliability by placing copies of data, at various points in a network, so that they are distributed closer to the user. The Windows Azure CDN today delivers many Microsoft products – such as Windows Update, Zune videos, and Bing Maps - which customers know and use every day. By adding the CDN to Windows Azure capabilities, we’ve made this large-scale network available to all our Windows Azure customers.</p>  <p>To date, this service has been available at no charge. Today, we’re announcing pricing for the Windows Azure CDN for all billing periods that begin <strong>after</strong> June 30, 2010. The following three billing meters and rates will apply for the CDN:</p>  <ul>   <li>$0.15 per GB for data transfers from European and North American locations </li>    <li>$0.20 per GB for data transfers from other locations </li>    <li>$0.01 per 10,000 transactions      <br></li> </ul>  <p>With 19 locations globally (United States, Europe, Asia, Australia and South America), the Windows Azure CDN offers developers a global solution for delivering high-bandwidth content. The Windows Azure CDN caches your Windows Azure blobs at strategically placed locations to provide maximum bandwidth for delivering your content to users.&#160; You can enable CDN delivery for any storage account via the Windows Azure Developer Portal.</p>  <p>Windows Azure CDN charges will not include fees associated with transferring this data from Windows Azure Storage to CDN. Any data transfers and storage transactions incurred to get data from Windows Azure Storage to the CDN will be charged separately at our normal Windows Azure Storage rates. CDN charges are incurred for data requests it receives and for the data it transfers out to satisfy these requests.</p>  <p>All usage for billing periods beginning prior to July 1, 2010 will not be charged.
