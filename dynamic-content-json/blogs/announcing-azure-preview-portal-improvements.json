    "Content": "Hi, Azure friends!\n\nToday we are proud to announce a set of improvements to the Azure Preview Portal. All of these enhancements are based on the great feedback that we have been getting from you. We are very thankful for that and look forward to more of it!\n\nThis post contains a detailed description of the changes, but if you are in a hurry here is a quick summary:\n<ul>\n <li>Improvements to the Resource Blades (scoped to Website and VM blades)\n<ul>\n <li>Show essential properties at the top of the blade</li>\n <li>Improve access to essential functionality (like Settings, Tags, RBAC, Quickstart)</li>\n <li>Improve the resource Settings\n<ul>\n <li>More comprehensive</li>\n <li>Improved search</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n <li>Improved Portal interactions\n<ul>\n <li>Improve how blades with tiles (or “parts” as we call them) display when maximized</li>\n <li>Make all grid columns resizable</li>\n <li>Show subscription name when you browse resources</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n <li>Improved personalization\n<ul>\n <li>Rename, move, delete, and add groups in resource blades (e.g. Websites, VM, etc.)</li>\n <li>Part Gallery that provides access to parts that can enrich your resource blades</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n <li>Improved browser interactions\n<ul>\n <li>Open blade in new tab</li>\n <li>Open blade in new window</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\nIf you have a bit more time, keep on reading!\n<h1>Improvements to resource blades</h1>\n<strong>Resource blades</strong> are the blades that surface Azure resources like Websites, VMs, SQL Databases, etc. They are a common starting point or destination when you use the Azure portal.\n\nIn this release we are introducing a set of features that improve the experience of those blades. These capabilities are available in the Website and VM blades.\n\nThese improvements include:\n<ul>\n <li><strong>Essentials Panel</strong>: Section at the top of the blade that displays relevant properties and provides access to Settings, QuickStart, RBAC (Role Based Access Control), Tags, and the associated Resource Group.</li>\n <li><strong>Simplified resource blades</strong>: These blades have been optimized for everyday use by relocating many parts for easier, quicker access</li>\n <li><strong>Improve settings blades: </strong>The settings blade (the one that provides access to all settings of a resource) is more comprehensive and includes improved search capabilities</li>\n</ul>\nThe image below shows a snippet of the improved Website blade:\n\n<a href=\"https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/blogmedia/blogmedia/2015/01/29/website-blade.png\"><img style=\"padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"website blade\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/website-blade_thumb.png\" alt=\"website blade\" width=\"586\" height=\"976\" border=\"0\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>The <strong>Essentials</strong> panel</h2>\nOnce you open a Website or VM blade the first difference that you will notice is the <strong>Essentials</strong> panel. This panel presents key information about the resource (in this case a Website) and is displayed at the top of the blade. Before we introduced this capability, you needed to get through a few clicks (and blades) to get access to this information. Now you can see this information as soon as you open up your <strong>Resource Blade</strong>!\n\n<a href=\"https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/blogmedia/blogmedia/2015/01/29/Essentials-panel.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-249252\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/Essentials-panel-571x369.png\" alt=\"Essentials panel\" width=\"571\" height=\"369\" /></a>\n\nThe <strong>Essentials</strong> panel goes beyond just showing properties—it also provides access to some core functionalities that are available to most resources like the <strong>Resource Group</strong>, the resource’s <strong>Settings </strong>blade, <strong>Quickstart</strong>, <strong>Role Base Access Controls (RBAC)</strong> and <strong>Tags</strong>.\n\n<a href=\"https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/blogmedia/blogmedia/2015/01/29/essentials-panel.png\"><img style=\"padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"essentials panel\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/essentials-panel_thumb.png\" alt=\"essentials panel\" width=\"1028\" height=\"378\" border=\"0\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nProviding this information and access to core functionality sets the stage for the next improvement: simplified resource blades.\n<h2>Simplified resource blades (Websites and VM)</h2>\nGiven the fact that the <strong>Essentials</strong> panel provides access to key functionality, we have removed the parts and part groups that previously reflected this essential information. We have removed the <strong>Summary</strong> and <strong>Access</strong> part groups (since all this is already available in the essentials panel), as well as many other parts that are now surfaced in the improved <strong>Settings</strong> blade (more on this <a href=\"#_Resource_Settings_blade\">below</a>).\n\nThe website blade went from <strong>29</strong> parts to <strong>19</strong> and VM from <strong>20</strong> to <strong>8</strong>. As a result, the updated blades (Website and VM for now) are <strong>simpler</strong>!\n<h2>Resource Settings blade improvements</h2>\nWe made the resource <strong>Settings</strong> blade more comprehensive. The pattern that we are trying to establish is that every time that you want to make a change to <em>any</em> resource that you own in Azure, you know <em>exactly</em> where to go!\n\nFor starters, we will be placing the <strong>Settings</strong> command first in all resource blades (so far just Websites and VMs, but the rest will follow soon). Access to <strong>Settings</strong> is also available from the bottom corner of the <strong>Essentials</strong> panel.\n\n<a href=\"https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/blogmedia/blogmedia/2015/01/29/Settings-Command.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-249201\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/Settings-Command-557x369.png\" alt=\"Settings Command\" width=\"557\" height=\"369\" /></a>\n\nWe also made sure that all relevant settings are available in the <strong>Settings</strong> blade. For example, the websites settings blade grew from <strong>10</strong> settings to <strong>15</strong> and VM from <strong>5</strong> to <strong>10.</strong>\n\nWe also introduced an improved <strong>search</strong> in the <strong>Settings</strong> blade. Notice how a search for “.NET Framework” returns the “Application Settings” blade for a Website (that is the place where the .NET Framework version can be changed).\n\n<a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/settings.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-248841\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/settings.png\" alt=\"settings.png\" width=\"311\" height=\"315\" /></a>\n<h1>Improved Portal Interactions</h1>\n<h2>Improve maximize blades</h2>\nMany of the blades in the portal can be <strong>maximized</strong>. This means that they can take advantage of all the available screen real estate. Recently we exposed the <strong>maximize</strong> button on the top of all blades that can be maximized to make this capability more accessible:\n\n<a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/running.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-248861 size-full\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/running.png\" alt=\"Maximize blade command\" width=\"581\" height=\"154\" /></a>\n\nIn this update we also improved the layout of a blade when it is maximized. Now, when a blade is maximized, the grouping of parts is preserved, resulting in a more predictable and usable layout.\n\nBefore this release, a maximized blade looked like this (using the Website blade as an example):\n\n<a href=\"https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/blogmedia/blogmedia/2015/01/29/web-blade.png\"><img style=\"padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"web blade\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/web-blade_thumb.png\" alt=\"web blade\" width=\"1028\" height=\"493\" border=\"0\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs of this update, maximized blades will look like this:\n\n<a href=\"https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/blogmedia/blogmedia/2015/01/29/updated-max-blades.png\"><img style=\"padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"updated max blades\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/updated-max-blades_thumb.png\" alt=\"updated max blades\" width=\"1028\" height=\"594\" border=\"0\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs you can notice, the groups and positions are preserved so the maximized blade now allows you to do work effectively leveraging all that space on your large monitor!\n\nThis capability is available to all blades that have parts.\n<h2>Resizable columns in all grids</h2>\nColumns in all grids can now be resized. When you hover on the header of a grid, you’ll see some handles on the edge of the columns that you can use to make columns smaller or larger. This is available on all grids in the portal!\n\n<a href=\"https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/blogmedia/blogmedia/2015/01/29/Columns-and-grids.png\"><img style=\"padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"Columns and grids\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/Columns-and-grids_thumb.png\" alt=\"Columns and grids\" width=\"1028\" height=\"405\" border=\"0\" /></a>\n<h2>Subscription name available in Browse</h2>\nWe have added subscription name to most resources in Browse. This will be applied to all resource types in a future update.\n<h1>Complete the personalization story</h1>\nThe Azure Preview Portal provides personalization capabilities that let you configure it to match the way in which you work. As you already know, all resource blades can be customized. This means that you can resize, remove, or move around any part.\n\nTo start customizing a blade you have to click the <strong>Customize</strong> command at the top of the blade (see image below)\n\n<a href=\"https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/blogmedia/blogmedia/2015/01/29/click-here.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-248941\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/click-here-636x306.png\" alt=\"Enter customize mode\" width=\"636\" height=\"306\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis sets the portal into <strong>Customize</strong> mode where you can make changes to your blade like resizing, moving, or removing parts.\n\nIn this update we have introduced two capabilities that make this personalization even better:\n<ul>\n <li><strong>Part gallery</strong>: add more parts to your blade</li>\n <li><strong>Part group management: </strong>rename, delete, add, and reorder groups of parts in your blades</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Part Group management</h2>\nYou can now rename, delete, or move groups of parts, as shown in the image below:\n\n<a href=\"https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/blogmedia/blogmedia/2015/01/29/Group-management.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-249171\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/Group-management-636x365.png\" alt=\"Group management\" width=\"636\" height=\"365\" /></a>\n\nAlso, you can add new groups at the bottom of the blade (and then move them up):\n\n<a href=\"https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/blogmedia/blogmedia/2015/01/29/new-groups.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-248981\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/new-groups-636x143.png\" alt=\"New part group\" width=\"636\" height=\"143\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Part Gallery</h2>\nAt the beginning of this post we mentioned how the resource blades have been simplified. If you miss any of the tiles that have been removed you can bring them back to your blade! The <strong>Part Gallery </strong>provides access to a set of tiles that you can use in your blade. Just drag a tile from the gallery and drop it in your blade.\n\nThe image below shows how to bring up the <strong>Part Gallery</strong>:\n\n<a href=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/part-gallery.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-249001\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/part-gallery.png\" alt=\"part-gallery.png\" width=\"608\" height=\"341\" /></a>\n\nThis will set the portal to <strong>Customize</strong> mode and will display the <strong>Part Gallery</strong>.\n\n<a href=\"https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/blogmedia/blogmedia/2015/01/29/customize-part-gallery.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-249021\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/customize-part-gallery-538x369.png\" alt=\"customize-part-gallery.png\" width=\"538\" height=\"369\" /></a>\n\nLet’s look at this gallery in a bit more of detail, again using the Website resource blade as an example:\n\n<a href=\"https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/blogmedia/blogmedia/2015/01/29/Part-gallery.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-249191\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/Part-gallery-394x369.png\" alt=\"Part gallery\" width=\"394\" height=\"369\" /></a>\n\nThe image below show the Part Gallery for a website filtered to the “Monitoring” category.\n\n<a href=\"https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/blogmedia/blogmedia/2015/01/29/Filtered-part-gallery.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-249161\" src=\"https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/Filtered-part-gallery-215x369.png\" alt=\"Filtered part gallery\" width=\"215\" height=\"369\" /></a>\n\nNotice how the parts that are displayed are only the ones that are related with monitoring, which in this case means a set of great charts and metrics for your website!\n<h1>Browser interactions</h1>\nOne common theme of portal feedback is that many of the most common browser interactions that everyone knows and loves are not available. This is an area that we are actively working on, so stay tuned for many more improvements!\n\nIn this release we are enabling “Open in new tab” and “Open in new window” for blades.\n\nTo open a blade a new tab, CTRL + Click on a part. To open it in a new browser window, SHIFT + Click. These gestures also work for most grids in the portal.\n\nYou may find a few issues here and there – this is work in progress, but given all the feedback that we got from you we wanted to put this out to you soon and get your feedback!\n\n&nbsp;\n<h1>Coming soon…</h1>\nThere is a lot of great stuff in this update. Our team is already working on the next set of improvements. Here are a few that you can expect to see soon:\n<ul>\n <li>Extension of the resource blade improvements to ALL resource types</li>\n <li>Updates to the browser URL as you navigate the portal</li>\n <li>Browser back button support</li>\n <li>More grid improvements</li>\n <li>Enhancements to our “Browse” resources experience</li>\n <li>Ability to filter by subscription</li>\n</ul>\nI’d like to end with a big thanks to <em>YOU. </em>Your feedback has driven the work for this update and all the work that we are currently doing.\n\nI hope you enjoy all of these new updates to the portal and look forward to hearing from you soon!"
