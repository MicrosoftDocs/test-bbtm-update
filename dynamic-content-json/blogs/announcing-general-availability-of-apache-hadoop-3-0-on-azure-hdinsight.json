In partnership with Cloudera, Microsoft Azure is the first cloud provider to offer customers the benefit of the latest innovations in the most popular open source analytics projects, with unmatched scalability, flexibility, and security. With the general availability of Apache Hadoop 3.0 on Azure HDInsight, we are building upon existing capabilities with a number of key enhancements that further improve performance and security, and deepen support for the rich ecosystem of big data analytics applications.</p>\n\n<h2>Bringing Apache Hadoop 3.0 and supercharged performance to the cloud</h2>\n\n<p>Apache Hadoop 3.0 represents over 5 years of major upgrades contributed by the open source community across key Apache frameworks such as Hive, Spark, and HBase. New features in Hadoop 3.0 provide significant improvements to performance, scalability, and availability, reducing total cost of ownership and accelerating time-to-value.</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li><strong>Apache Hive 3.0</strong> &ndash; With ACID transactions on by default and several performance improvements, this latest version of Hive enables developers to build &ldquo;traditional database&rdquo; applications on massive data lakes. This is particularly important for enterprises who need to build GDPR/privacy compliant big data applications.</li>\n <li><strong>Hive Warehouse Connector for Apache Spark</strong> &ndash; With the Hive Warehouse Connector, the Spark and Hive worlds are coming closer together. The new connector moves the integration from the metastore layer to the query engine layer. This enables higher, more reliable performance with predicate pushdown and other functionality.</li>\n <li><strong>Apache HBase 2.0 and Apache Phoenix 5.0</strong> &ndash; Apache HBase 2.0 and Apache Phoenix 5.0 introduce a number of performance, stability, and integration improvements. With HBase 2.0, periodic reorganization of the data in the memstore with in-memory compactions improves performance as data is not flushed or read too often from remote cloud storage. Phoenix 5.0 brings more visibility into queries with query log by introducing a new system table that captures information about queries that are being run against the cluster.</li>\n <li><strong>Spark IO Cache</strong> &ndash; IO Cache is a data caching service for Azure HDInsight that improves the performance of Apache Spark jobs. IO Cache also works with <a href=\"https://tez.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache TEZ</a> and <a href=\"https://hive.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Hive</a> workloads, which can be run on <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Spark</a> clusters.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Enhanced enterprise grade security</h2>\n\n<p>Enterprise grade security and compliance is a critical requirement for all customers building big data applications that store or process sensitive data in the cloud.</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li><strong>Enterprise Security Package (ESP) support for Apache HBase</strong> &ndash; With the general availability of ESP support for HBase, customers can ensure that users authenticate to their HDInsight HBase clusters using their corporate domain credentials and are subject to rich, fine-grained access policies (authored and managed in Apache Ranger).</li>\n <li><strong>Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) support for Apache Kafka</strong> &ndash; Customers can now bring their own encryption keys into the Azure Key Vault and use them to encrypt the Azure Managed Disks storing their Apache Kafka messages. This gives them a high degree of control over the security of their data.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Rich developer tooling</h2>\n\n<p>Azure HDInsight offers rich development experiences with various integrated development environment (IDE) extensions, notebooks, and SDKs.</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li><strong>SDKs general availability</strong> &ndash; HDInsight SDKs for <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/overview/azure/hdinsight\" target=\"_blank\">.NET</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/hdinsight\" target=\"_blank\">Python</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/java/api/overview/azure/hdinsight\" target=\"_blank\">Java</a> enable developers to easily manage clusters using the language of their choice.</li>\n <li><strong>VSCode</strong> &ndash; <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-for-vscode\" target=\"_blank\">HDInsight VSCode extension</a> enables developers to submit Hive batch jobs, interactive Hive queries, and PySpark scripts to HDInsight 4.0 clusters.</li>\n <li><strong>IntelliJ</strong> &ndash; <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/spark/apache-spark-intellij-tool-plugin\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ</a> enables Scala and Java developers to program Spark, Scala, and Java projects with built-in templates. Developers can easily perform local run, local debug, open interactive sessions, and submit Scala/Java projects to HDInsight 4.0 Spark clusters directly from the IntelliJ integrated development environment.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Broad application ecosystem</h2>\n\n<p>Azure HDInsight supports a vibrant application ecosystem with a variety of <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/hdinsight/partner-ecosystem/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>popular big data applications available on Azure Marketplace</strong></a>, covering scenarios from interactive analytics to application migration.
