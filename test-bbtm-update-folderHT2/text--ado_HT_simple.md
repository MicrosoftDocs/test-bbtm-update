# Test Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects (ADO)

ADO is used in C++ programs to connect to SQL Server. Of course, it also works to connect to Azure SQL Database in the cloud.

Each section in this article describes a component of ADO.

  
## ADO  
 Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) enable your client applications to access and manipulate data from a variety of sources through an OLE DB provider. Its primary benefits are ease of use, high speed, low memory overhead, and a small disk footprint. ADO supports key features for building client/server and Web-based applications.  
  
## Support  
 For free help with ADO issues, try posting to the ADO public newsgroup. This newsgroup is monitored by Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) support professionals who cover ADO, and by other experienced ADO developers.  
  
 Further information about support options can be found on the Microsoft Help and Support Web site.
